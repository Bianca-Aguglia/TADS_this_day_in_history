       "     'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa.

He was the son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]]. He succeeded his first cousin once removed [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], who died without a son.\\n\\nA prodigious [[patron of the arts]], he promoted the emergent [[French Renaissance]] by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who brought the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of [[humanism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the beginning of French exploration of the [[New World]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already [[Count of Angoulême]] after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of [[Duke of Valois]].<ref name=\"Knecht3\" />\\n\\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter [[Claude of France|Claude]] and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 8–9.</ref> Claude was heir presumptive to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] through her mother, [[Anne of Brittany]]. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 11.</ref> On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the [[Cathedral of Reims]] on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his [[Queen consort of France|queen consort]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 16.</ref>\\n\\n==Reign==\\n[[File:François 1515.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Francis I painted in 1515]]\\n[[File:Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, 1494-1547, King of France 1515 (obverse), 1515 or after, NGA 44648.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, (obverse)]]\\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W.

Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]].

This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. [[Martin Luther]]\\'s preaching and writing sparked the [[Protestant Reformation]], which spread through much of Europe, including France.\\n\\n[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mérindol massacre|Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545]]\\n\\nInitially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister [[Marguerite de Navarre]], who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the [[Place Maubert]].<ref>[[Pierre Goubert]], \\'\\'The Course of French History\\'\\' Psychology Press, 1991, p. 92.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis\\' attitude towards [[Protestantism]] changed for the worse following the \"[[Affair of the Placards]]\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic [[Mass (Catholicism)|mass]]. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile.

Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the [[Waldensians]], at the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.\\n\\n===Death===\\nFrancis died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday.

He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]].

       "     'opening_text': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

He was the son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]]. He succeeded his first cousin once removed [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], who died without a son.\\n\\nA prodigious [[patron of the arts]], he promoted the emergent [[French Renaissance]] by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who brought the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of [[humanism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the beginning of French exploration of the [[New World]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already [[Count of Angoulême]] after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of [[Duke of Valois]].<ref name=\"Knecht3\" />\\n\\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter [[Claude of France|Claude]] and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 8–9.</ref> Claude was heir presumptive to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] through her mother, [[Anne of Brittany]]. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 11.</ref> On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the [[Cathedral of Reims]] on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his [[Queen consort of France|queen consort]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 16.</ref>\\n\\n==Reign==\\n[[File:François 1515.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Francis I painted in 1515]]\\n[[File:Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, 1494-1547, King of France 1515 (obverse), 1515 or after, NGA 44648.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, (obverse)]]\\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\"<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Francis I. of France | volume=10 |page=935 |first=Jules |last=Isaac |authorlink=Jules Isaac}}</ref> In the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1971) p. 314.</ref> during the reign of [[Louis XI, King of France|Louis XI]].  Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canada Quebec 1534–2000|last=Lacoursière|first=Jacques|publisher=Septentrion|year=2005|isbn=978-2894481868|location=Québec|page=28}}</ref>\\n\\nIn order to counterbalance the power of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the [[New World]] through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n\\nThe port city now known as [[Le Havre]] was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]], whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named \\'\\'Franciscopolis\\'\\' after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\\n\\n====Americas====\\n{{further|France-Americas relations}}\\nIn 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of [[Lyon]] in financing the expedition of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of [[New York City]], naming it [[New Angoulême]], and claimed [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the French crown.

This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. [[Martin Luther]]\\'s preaching and writing sparked the [[Protestant Reformation]], which spread through much of Europe, including France.\\n\\n[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mérindol massacre|Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545]]\\n\\nInitially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister [[Marguerite de Navarre]], who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the [[Place Maubert]].<ref>[[Pierre Goubert]], \\'\\'The Course of French History\\'\\' Psychology Press, 1991, p. 92.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis\\' attitude towards [[Protestantism]] changed for the worse following the \"[[Affair of the Placards]]\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic [[Mass (Catholicism)|mass]]. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.<ref>R. J. Knecht, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvEBMIIcHQkC&pg=PA405 \\'\\'Francis I\\']\\'\\' pp.405–406</ref>\\n\\nPersecutions against Protestants were codified in the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1540)]] issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the [[Waldensians]], at the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.\\n\\n===Death===\\nFrancis died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cavendish|first1=Richard|title=The Marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots {{!}} History Today|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/marriage-mary-queen-scots|website=www.historytoday.com}}</ref> He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in [[Saint Denis Basilica]].

Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian [[Jules Michelet]] set the negative image.<ref>Robert J.

He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]]. The couple had seven children:\\n* Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] almost from birth until death.\\n* [[Charlotte of Valois|Charlotte]] (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] from 1518 until death.\\n* [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless.\\n* [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559).

The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was [[Françoise de Foix]], Countess of [[Châteaubriant]]. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly [[Mary Boleyn]], mistress of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450</ref>\\n\\n==Francis I in films, stage and literature==\\nThe amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by [[Fanny Kemble]], \\'\\'Francis the First\\'\\', and the 1832 play by [[Victor Hugo]], \\'\\'[[Le Roi s\\'amuse]]\\'\\' (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester [[Triboulet]], the inspiration for the 1851 opera \\'\\'[[Rigoletto (opera)|Rigoletto]]\\'\\' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].\\n\\nFrancis was first played in a [[George Méliès]] movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), [[Aimé Simon-Girard]] (1937), [[Sacha Guitry]] (1937), [[Gérard Oury]] (1953), [[Jean Marais]] (1955), [[Pedro Armendáriz]] (1956), [[Claude Titre]] (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990).

The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\\n\\nHe is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel \\'\\'Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé\\'\\', where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\\n\\nHe often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – [[Mary Boleyn]] (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels \\'\\'The Lady in the Tower\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],\\'\\' \\'\\'The Last Boleyn\\'\\', \\'\\'Dear Heart, How Like You This?\\'\\' and \\'\\'Mademoiselle Boleyn\\'\\' feature Francis in their story. He appears in [[Hilary Mantel]]\\'s \\'\\'Wolf Hall\\'\\' about Henry VIII\\'s minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] and is often referred to in its sequel, \\'\\'Bring Up the Bodies\\'\\'.\\n\\nFrancis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel \\'\\'Courtesan\\'\\' about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.\\n\\nFrancis appears as the patron of [[Benvenuto Cellini]] in the 1843 French novel \\'\\'L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio\\'\\' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].\\n\\n[[Samuel Shellabarger]]\\'s novel \\'\\'The King\\'s Cavalier\\'\\' describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.\\n\\nHe was a recurring character in the Showtime series \\'\\'[[The Tudors]]\\'\\', opposite [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[Anne Boleyn]].

       "  'opening_text': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

       "     'text': 'Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879\\xa0– 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\" Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein\\'s father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later. In 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school\\'s regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor\\'s note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\". Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time \"[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\" His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\". At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason, and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: \"At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant\\'s works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\" In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler\\'s daughter, Marie. Albert\\'s sister Maja later married Winteler\\'s son Paul. In January 1896, with his father\\'s approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post. Einstein\\'s future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein\\'s and Marić\\'s friendship developed into romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra-curricular physics in which they were both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Marić that he preferred studying alongside her. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal teaching diploma. There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate Marić might have collaborated with Einstein prior to his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies, although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions. Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named \"Lieserl\", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein\\'s letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy. Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that despite their close relationship before, Einstein\\'s chief romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal; she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein transferred his Nobel Prize fund to Marić when he won it. Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\" He spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, after having a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936. In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton). Among Einstein\\'s well-known friends were Michele Besso, Paul Ehrenfest, Marcel Grossmann, János Plesch, Daniel Q. Posin, Maurice Solovine, Stephen Samuel Wise and Fritz Haber. After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but for medical reasons was not conscripted. With the help of Marcel Grossmann\\'s father, he secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner – level III. Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\". Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical–mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time. With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook. In 1900, Einstein\\'s paper \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena\") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions. Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein\\'s annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26. By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909. Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann. When the ″Manifesto of the Ninety-Three″ was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany\\'s militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic ″Manifesto to the Europeans″. On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership[clarification needed] in the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established. Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus Berlin University[clarification needed] on 1 April 1914.[clarification needed] As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918). Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun\\'s gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science\\xa0– New Theory of the Universe\\xa0– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\". In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921. He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925. Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King\\'s College London. He also published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America (1835). For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\" In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. In his own travel diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018. Because of Einstein\\'s travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist. On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein\\'s talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world. Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences. From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924), a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals. Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values. Einstein\\'s former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee. In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all. After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\". Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York\\'s Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism\", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech\\'s students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good. This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein\\'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy\". Chaplin\\'s film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein\\'s biographer, described this as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity\". Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was \"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis\". In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany\\'s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler. While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family\\'s apartment in Berlin. He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which was passed on 23 March and transformed Hitler\\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp. In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed. A month later, Einstein\\'s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, \"...\\xa0I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\" After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\". Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933. Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the Allies\\' technology ahead of theirs. Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey\\'s Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein\\'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\". Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany\\'s treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar. In October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s. Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship. Einstein\\'s affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group\\'s warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. The letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. For Einstein, \"war was a disease\\xa0... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them\\xa0...\" In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education. Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\", seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next\". As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case. In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925 and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel\\'s first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \"deeply moved\", and \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it. Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music.\" His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age. When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\" At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\" Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart\\'s work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation. In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart\\'s works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein\\'s level of coordination and intonation\". In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. However, later in his life, Einstein\\'s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\" His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \\'well-regulated system of government\\' and called their rule a \\'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\\'. He later adopted a more balanced view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind\\'s conscience.\" Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long. Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he exchanged written letters. He described Gandhi as \"a role model for the generations to come\". Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews. Einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza\\'s philosophy. He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\". When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, \"No. And one life is enough for me.\" Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without \\'ethical culture\\' there is no salvation for humanity.\" In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote: The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything \\'chosen\\' about them. On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel\\'s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it. Einstein refused surgery, saying, \"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\" He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end. During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein\\'s brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein\\'s remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965, at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: \"He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness\\xa0... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.\" Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein\\'s papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein\\'s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others. The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are: Einstein\\'s first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena. Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter. Einstein\\'s \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell\\'s equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein\\'s writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown. This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous. In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E\\xa0=\\xa0mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck. Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski\\'s formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity. General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light. In 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally. In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed. The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein\\'s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction. While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only. In June 1913, the Entwurf (\\'draft\\') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of Mach\\'s principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein\\'s static universe. Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\". In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated. In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel\\'s [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\" It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea. General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether\\'s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether\\'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others. In 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches. If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way. In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s. The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein field equations, which describe how space curves. The geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations. Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself. This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects. In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein\\'s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan\\'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering. Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck\\'s constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect. In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model. Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements. Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics. In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose\\'s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose\\'s paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein\\'s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University. Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck\\'s energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck\\'s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie\\'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger\\'s work of 1926. Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete. The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics. In 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the \"EPR paper\". In a thought experiment, he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. Given Einstein\\'s concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\"). Einstein\\'s belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell\\'s theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\" Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory. Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"unified field theory\" in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\". Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein\\'s approaches to unification. Einstein\\'s dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting. Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research. In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists. Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron\\'s angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization. Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.[citation needed] This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation. In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux. While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University\\'s Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university. The Einstein rights were litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the Einstein rights had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The court\\'s initial decision no longer has any legal impact or effect of any kind. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The Einstein rights are enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of those rights. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\" Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine\\'s Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist\\'s dream come true\". Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him. Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.

She has even turned upon her most glorious citizen, Albert Einstein, who is the supreme example of the selfless intellectual...The man, who, beyond all others, approximates a citizen of the world, is without a home. How proud we must be to offer him temporary shelter.\" In his paper, Einstein wrote: \"The introduction of a \\'luminiferous æther\\' will be proved to be superfluous in so far, as according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce neither a \\'space absolutely at rest\\' endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place.\" For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Glick (1987). In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design\\'s efficiency to be quadrupled. Citations Heilbron, John L., ed. (2003).

Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss [[Federal Polytechnic School]] in [[Zürich]] in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a [[patent examiner]] at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]].\\n\\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of [[classical mechanics]] could no longer be reconciled with those of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led him to develop his [[special theory of relativity]] during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his \\'\\'[[annus mirabilis]]\\'\\' (\\'miracle year\\'), he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]] which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained [[Brownian motion]], the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zurich]].\\n\\nAlthough initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the [[University of Bern]] in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to [[Charles University in Prague]] before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]], where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.<ref name=\"Nobel\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20151124\" />\\n\\nIn 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power. Because of his [[Jewish]] background, Einstein did not return to Germany.<ref name=\"zE9Bz\" /> He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.<ref name=\"BoyerDubofsky2001\" /> On the eve of [[World War II]], he endorsed [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential [[German nuclear weapons program]] and recommending that the US begin [[Manhattan Project|similar research]]. Einstein supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but generally denounced the idea of [[nuclear weapons]].\\n\\nEinstein was affiliated with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], until his death in 1955.

At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59–61]}}\\n\\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref name=\"EQyag\" /> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school\\'s regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor\\'s note.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=30–31}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether (classical element)|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field\".{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref name=\"1RgTv\" />\\n\\nEinstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.

During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully.\\n\\n==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====\\n{{See also|Einstein–Szilárd letter}}\\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group\\'s warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\"{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=630}}<ref name=\"o4fkQ\" /> To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.<ref name=\"pRqWK\" /> He was asked to lend his support by writing [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]], with Szilárd, to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\\n\\nThe letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\".<ref name=\"4Z68g\" /> In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the [[Belgian Royal Family]]<ref name=\"eZym8\" /> and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]].\\n\\nFor Einstein, \"war was a disease&nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.<ref name=\"z73PK\" /> In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them&nbsp;...\"{{Sfnp|Clark|1971|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], signed [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto|a manifesto]] highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.\\n\\n==== US citizenship ====\\n[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting [[Citizenship of the United States|US citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]\\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=432}}\\n\\nEinstein joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[Civil rights movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\",<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next\".{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2005|pp=148–149}} As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951.{{sfnp|Robeson|2002|p=565}} When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.<ref name=\"civil\" />\\n\\nIn 1946 Einstein visited [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania, a [[historically black college]], where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to [[African Americans]]; alumni include [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\"<ref name=\"Jerome_Isis\" /> A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.<ref name=\"civil\" />\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n==== Assisting Zionist causes ====\\n[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein in 1947]]\\nEinstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]],<ref>{{cite newspaper\\n    |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\\n   |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/science/brace-yourself-here-comes-einsteins-year.html\\n   |title=Brace Yourself!

Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the [[World Zionist Organization]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], to help raise funds for the planned university.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=290}} He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.\\n\\nAmong those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=161}} Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=158}}\\n\\nChaim Weizmann later became Israel\\'s first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of [[Ezriel Carlebach]], Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] offered Einstein the position of [[President of Israel]], a mostly ceremonial post.<ref name=\"Time\" /><ref name=\"Msb2q\" /> The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, [[Abba Eban]], who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}} Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \"deeply moved\", and \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}}\\n\\n==== Love of music ====\\n[[File:Rabindranath with Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein (right) with writer, musician and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1930]]\\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music.\"<ref name=\"BQH5A\" /><ref name=\"aBOjz\" />\\n\\nHis mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\\n\\nWhen he turned 13, he discovered the [[Mozart violin sonatas|violin sonatas of Mozart]], whereupon he became enamored of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\"<ref name=\"Botstein\" /> At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing [[Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas (disambiguation)<!-- intentional -->|Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas]]. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\"<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\\n\\nMusic took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Köchel catalog]] of Mozart\\'s work; that edition was prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]], who may have been a distant relation.<ref name=\"kGuWC\" /><ref name=\"OIn6p\" />\\n\\nIn 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and Mozart\\'s works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].<ref name=\"Times\" /><ref name=\"RR\" /> Near the end of his life, when the young [[Juilliard Quartet]] visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein\\'s level of coordination and intonation\".<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\\n\\n==== Political and religious views ====\\n{{Main|Political views of Albert Einstein|Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein}}\\n[[File:Einsteinwiezmann.PNG|alt=Casual group shot of four men and two women standing on a brick pavement.|thumb|Albert Einstein with his wife [[Elsa Einstein]] and Zionist leaders, including future [[President of Israel]] [[Chaim Weizmann]], his wife [[Vera Weizmann]], [[Menahem Ussishkin]], and Ben-Zion Mossinson on arrival in New York City in 1921]]\\n\\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the [[German Democratic Party]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]] party.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=83}} However, later in his life, Einstein\\'s political view was in favor of [[socialism]] and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"[[Why Socialism?]]\"{{sfnp|Einstein|1949}}<ref name=\"LXsUJ\"/> His opinions on the [[Bolsheviks]] also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \\'well-regulated system of government\\' and called their rule a \\'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\\'. He later adopted a more balanced view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on [[Vladimir Lenin]]: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind\\'s conscience.\"{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_X1dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA413 412, 413]}} Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic [[World government|global government]] that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=487, 494, 550}} The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.<ref name=\"ixWWZ\" />\\n\\nEinstein was deeply impressed by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with whom he exchanged written letters. He described Gandhi as \"a role model for the generations to come\".<ref name=\"Albano-Müller\" />\\n\\nEinstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews.<ref name=\"018QJ\" /> Einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] God of [[Spinozism|Baruch Spinoza\\'s philosophy]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&pg=PA325 325]}} He did not believe in a [[personal god]] who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2000|p=218}} He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\",{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&pg=PT390 390]}} preferring to call himself an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&pg=PA340 340]}}<ref name=\"flickr2687\"/> or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\".{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2000|p=218}} When asked if he believed in an [[afterlife]], Einstein replied, \"No. And one life is enough for me.\"{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OzSJgdwk5esC&pg=PT461 461]}}\\n\\nEinstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious [[Secular humanist|humanist]] and [[Ethical Culture]] groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]],<ref name=\"mKToJ\" /> and was an honorary associate of the [[Rationalist Association]], which publishes \\'\\'[[New Humanist]]\\'\\' in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]], he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without \\'ethical culture\\' there is no salvation for humanity.\"{{sfnp|Einstein|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fJkBqwDD3sC&pg=PA62 62]}}\\n\\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher [[Eric Gutkind]], dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:<blockquote>The word [[God (word)|God]] is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the [[Bible]] a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the [[Jewish religion]] like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions.

These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of [[History of physics#Modern physics|modern physics]] and changed views on [[space]], time, and [[matter]].

It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=\"PubList\" />\\n\\n==== Theory of critical opalescence ====\\n{{Main|Critical opalescence}}\\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref name=\"L2N73\" /> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\\n\\n=== Special relativity ===\\n{{Main|History of special relativity}}\\nEinstein\\'s \"\\'\\'Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\\'\\'\"{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}} (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between [[Maxwell\\'s equations]] (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=178–198}} Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein\\'s writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown.<ref name=\"mileva\" />\\n\\nThis paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to [[Time dilation|slow down]], and the body itself would [[Length contraction|contract]] in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"aBfxO\" />\\n\\nIn his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]], Einstein produced \\'\\'E\\'\\'&nbsp;=&nbsp;\\'\\'mc\\'\\'<sup>2</sup> as a consequence of his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA215 215]}} Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref group=note name=\"sBl2q\" />{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382–386}}\\n\\nEinstein originally framed special relativity in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of [[spacetime]]. Einstein adopted Minkowski\\'s formalism in his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=151–152}}\\n\\n=== General relativity ===\\n\\n==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====\\n{{Main|History of general relativity}}\\n{{See also|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}\\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]\\'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\\n\\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179–183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900–1909|pp=273–274}}\\n\\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194–195}}\\n\\n====Gravitational waves====\\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,{{sfnp|Einstein|1916}}{{sfnp|Einstein|1918}} ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\\n\\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /><ref name=\"Tf1T0\" /> Einstein\\'s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at [[LIGO]] published the [[first observation of gravitational waves]],<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\" /> detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /><ref name=\"CO6kH\" /><ref name=\"oSmHb\" /><ref name=\"hkKSp\" /><ref name=\"38Msx\" />\\n\\n==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====\\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\\n\\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\\'draft\\') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref name=\"sOA9t\" /> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\\n\\n==== Physical cosmology ====\\n{{Main|Physical cosmology}}\\n[[File:MillikanLemaitreEinstein.jpg|thumb|right|Einstein with [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in January 1933.]]\\n\\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of [[Mach\\'s principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein\\'s static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285–286}}<ref name=\"iJwuX\" />\\n\\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name=\"cor-2013\" /> and the [[Einstein–de Sitter universe]] of 1932.{{sfnp|Einstein|de Sitter|1932}}<ref name=\"J9Tqu\" /> In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name=\"cor-2013\" /><ref name=\"sxfvo\" />\\n\\nIn many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.<ref name=\"qmmVf\" />\\n\\nIn late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the universe.<ref name=\"Tq53z\" /><ref name=\"8pfEk\" /> In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\" /><ref name=\"Einstein\\'s aborted model\" /> As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel\\'s [\\'\\'sic\\'\\'] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"\\n\\nIt thus appears that Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.<ref name=\"ILjYQ\" /><ref name=\"ThZb0\" /> However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\" /><ref name=\"Einstein\\'s aborted model\" /><ref name=\"7ShC9\" />\\n\\n==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====\\n{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}\\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether\\'s theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether\\'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\\n\\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\\n\\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.\\n\\n==== Wormholes ====\\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein–Rosen bridges]].{{sfnp|Einstein|Rosen|1935}}<ref name=\"QNjpt\" /> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.<ref name=\"ja7FY\" />\\n\\nIf one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\\n\\n==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====\\n{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}\\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\\n\\n==== Equations of motion ====\\n{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}\\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law{{mdash}}the [[Einstein field equations]], which describe how space curves. The [[geodesic equation]], which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.\\n\\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\\n\\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\\n\\n=== Old quantum theory ===\\n{{Main|Old quantum theory}}\\n\\n==== Photons and energy quanta ====\\n[[File:Photoelectric effect in a solid - diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\\nIn a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (\\'\\'[[quantum|quanta]]\\'\\'). Einstein\\'s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]\\'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\\n\\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency \\'\\'f\\'\\' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy \\'\\'hf\\'\\' each, where \\'\\'h\\'\\' is [[Planck\\'s constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\\n\\n==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====\\n{{Main|Einstein solid}}\\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref name=\"ixm32\" />\\n\\n==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====\\n{{main|Adiabatic invariant}}\\nThroughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\\n\\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien\\'s displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.\\n\\n==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====\\n{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}\\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose\\'s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose\\'s paper to the \\'\\'[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]\\'\\'. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref name=\"nlagl\" /> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein\\'s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<ref name=\"Instituut-Lorentz\" />\\n\\n==== Wave–particle duality ====\\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]\\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a \\'\\'[[Privatdozent]]\\'\\' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In \"\\'\\'Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\\'\\'\" (\"[[s:Translation:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]\"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck\\'s energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the \\'\\'photon\\'\\' concept (although the name \\'\\'photon\\'\\' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\\n\\n==== Zero-point energy ====\\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of [[zero-point energy]] in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912–1914|pp=270ff}}\\n\\n==== Stimulated emission ====\\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in \\'\\'Physikalische Zeitschrift\\'\\' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck\\'s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\\n\\n==== Matter waves ====\\nEinstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]\\'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger\\'s work of 1926.\\n\\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\\n==== Einstein\\'s objections to quantum mechanics ====\\n[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]\\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\".<ref name=\"zZ2hS\" /> Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.<ref name=\"yzZtL\" />\\n\\n==== Bohr versus Einstein ====\\n{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}\\n[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks skeptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name=\"Bohr1949\" />{{Sfnp|Einstein|1969}}{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} Their debates would influence later [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].\\n\\n==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====\\nIn 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the [[EPR paradox|\"EPR paper\"]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} In a [[Einstein\\'s thought experiments|thought experiment]], he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448–453}}\\n\\nGiven Einstein\\'s concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448–453}}\\n\\nEinstein\\'s belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell\\'s theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}\\n\\nAlthough Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|\\'\\'entangled quantum states\\'\\']], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]]. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}\\n\\n=== Unified field theory ===\\n{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}\\nFollowing his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified field theory]]\" in a \\'\\'[[Scientific American]]\\'\\' article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\\nIn his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein\\'s approaches to unification. Einstein\\'s dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\\n\\n=== Other investigations ===\\n{{Main|Einstein\\'s unsuccessful investigations}}\\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.\\n\\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world\\'s top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]\\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\\n\\n==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====\\n{{Main|Einstein–de Haas effect}}\\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron\\'s angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\\n\\n==== Schrödinger gas model ====\\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\\n\\nThis formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref name=\"4IMf2\" />\\n\\n==== Einstein refrigerator ====\\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.<ref name=\"Goettling\" /> On 11 November 1930, {{US patent|1781541}} was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]].{{refn |group=note |In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator.

The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986<ref name=\"margot-obituary\" />).

Although the court initially held that the Einstein rights had expired,<ref name=\"casetext-hebrew-university\" /> that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The court\\'s initial decision no longer has any legal impact or effect of any kind. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The Einstein rights are enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of those rights.<ref name=\"pacermonitor-hebrew-university\" />\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\n{{Main|Albert Einstein in popular culture}}\\nIn the period before World War II, \\'\\'[[The New Yorker]]\\'\\' published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry!

       "     'opening_text': 'Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879\\xa0– 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\"',\n",

His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula <span><i>E</i> = <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup></span>, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.\\n</p><p>The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.\\n</p><p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his <i>annus mirabilis</i> (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.\\n</p><p>Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.</p><p>In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.\\n</p><p>Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\"</p>',\n",

       "     'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

He was the son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]]. He succeeded his first cousin once removed [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], who died without a son.\\n\\nA prodigious [[patron of the arts]], he promoted the emergent [[French Renaissance]] by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who brought the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of [[humanism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the beginning of French exploration of the [[New World]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already [[Count of Angoulême]] after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of [[Duke of Valois]].<ref name=\"Knecht3\" />\\n\\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter [[Claude of France|Claude]] and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 8–9.</ref> Claude was heir presumptive to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] through her mother, [[Anne of Brittany]].

He was crowned King of France in the [[Cathedral of Reims]] on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his [[Queen consort of France|queen consort]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 16.</ref>\\n\\n==Reign==\\n[[File:François 1515.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Francis I painted in 1515]]\\n[[File:Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, 1494-1547, King of France 1515 (obverse), 1515 or after, NGA 44648.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, (obverse)]]\\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\"<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Francis I. of France | volume=10 |page=935 |first=Jules |last=Isaac |authorlink=Jules Isaac}}</ref> In the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1971) p. 314.</ref> during the reign of [[Louis XI, King of France|Louis XI]].  Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others.

Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n\\nThe port city now known as [[Le Havre]] was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]], whose utility had decreased due to silting.

This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. [[Martin Luther]]\\'s preaching and writing sparked the [[Protestant Reformation]], which spread through much of Europe, including France.\\n\\n[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mérindol massacre|Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545]]\\n\\nInitially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister [[Marguerite de Navarre]], who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the [[Place Maubert]].<ref>[[Pierre Goubert]], \\'\\'The Course of French History\\'\\' Psychology Press, 1991, p. 92.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis\\' attitude towards [[Protestantism]] changed for the worse following the \"[[Affair of the Placards]]\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic [[Mass (Catholicism)|mass]]. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.<ref>R. J. Knecht, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvEBMIIcHQkC&pg=PA405 \\'\\'Francis I\\']\\'\\' pp.405–406</ref>\\n\\nPersecutions against Protestants were codified in the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1540)]] issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the [[Waldensians]], at the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.\\n\\n===Death===\\nFrancis died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday.

He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]].

In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done.

Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels \\'\\'The Lady in the Tower\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],\\'\\' \\'\\'The Last Boleyn\\'\\', \\'\\'Dear Heart, How Like You This?\\'\\' and \\'\\'Mademoiselle Boleyn\\'\\' feature Francis in their story.

       "     'opening_text': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son.\\n</p><p>A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the <i>Mona Lisa</i> with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.\\n</p><p>For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as <i>le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres</i> (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as <i>François au Grand Nez</i> (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the <i>Grand Colas</i>, and the <i>Roi-Chevalier</i> (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain.\\n</p><p>Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.</p>',\n",

       "     'text': 'The Nika riots (Greek: Στάσις τοῦ Νίκα Stásis toû Níka), Nika revolt or Nika sedition took place against Emperor Justinian I in Constantinople over the course of a week in 532 AD. They were the most violent riots in the city\\'s history, with nearly half of Constantinople being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed. The ancient Roman and Byzantine empires had well-developed associations, known as demes, which supported the different factions (or teams) under which competitors in certain sporting events took part; this was particularly true of chariot racing. There were initially four major factional teams of chariot racing, differentiated by the colour of the uniform in which they competed; the colours were also worn by their supporters. These were the Blues (Veneti), the Greens (Prasini), the Reds (Russati), and the Whites (Albati), although by the Byzantine era the only teams with any influence were the Blues and Greens. Emperor Justinian I was a supporter of the Blues. The team associations had become a focus for various social and political issues for which the general Byzantine population lacked other forms of outlet. They combined aspects of street gangs and political parties, taking positions on current issues, notably theological problems or claimants to the throne. They frequently tried to affect the policy of the emperors by shouting political demands between races. The imperial forces and guards in the city could not keep order without the cooperation of the circus factions which were in turn backed by the aristocratic families of the city; these included some families who believed they had a more rightful claim to the throne than Justinian.[citation needed] In 531 some members of the Blues and Greens had been arrested for murder in connection with deaths that occurred during rioting after a recent chariot race. Relatively limited riots were not unknown at chariot races, similar to the football hooliganism that occasionally erupts after association football matches in modern times. The murderers were to be executed, and most of them were. But on January 10, 532, two of them, a Blue and a Green, escaped and were taking refuge in the sanctuary of a church surrounded by an angry mob. Justinian was nervous: he was in the midst of negotiating with the Persians over peace in the east at the end of the Iberian War and now he faced a potential crisis in his city. Facing this, he declared that a chariot race would be held on January 13 and commuted the sentences to imprisonment. The Blues and the Greens responded by demanding that the two men be pardoned entirely.[citation needed] Justinian and two of his leading officials, John the Cappadocian and Tribonian, were extremely unpopular because of the high taxes they levied, the corruption of the latter two and John\\'s cruelty against debtors. John and Justinian had also reduced spending on the civil service and combated the corruption of the civil service. The many nobles who had lost their power and fortune when removed from the smaller, less corrupt civil service joined the ranks of the Greens. Justinian was also reducing the power of both teams, the Greens seeing this as further imperial oppression akin to the reforms in the civil service, while the Blues felt betrayed. The Roman legal code had a popular image as the biggest distinguishing feature of the civilized Romans as compared to \"barbarians\" (Latin: barbari). The law code was also religiously important as the Romans were believed to be \"chosen by God\", it being a symbol of justice. As such it brought legitimacy with it if an emperor successfully made significant legal reforms but if this process bogged down it showed divine anger. What had taken nine years for the Theodosian code took Justinian just thirteen months. Just before the Nika riots of January 532, however, the pace of reforms had slowed to a crawl. At the same time Justinian was fighting an unsuccessful war against the Persians; while Byzantine victories at Dara (spring of 530) and Satala (summer of 530) had fostered his legitimacy for a short while, the defeat at Calinicum (531) and negative strategic situation damaged the emperor\\'s reputation. On top of that the legal reforms were unpopular with the aristocracy from the start, as they made it impossible to use obscure laws and jurisprudence to avoid unfavorable verdicts, further angering the aristocracy. On top of this both Justinian and his wife Theodora were of low birth - late Roman and Byzantine society was not as class driven as the feudal-dominated society of the west. The Greens were a Monophysite group and represented the interest of the moneyed non-landowners, Justinian being neither of those. When Justinian refused to pardon the two arrested rioters there was already a deep-seated resentment among the general populace as well as among the aristocracy. On January 13, 532, a tense and angry populace arrived at the Hippodrome for the races.[citation needed] The Hippodrome was next to the palace complex, and thus Justinian could watch from the safety of his box in the palace and preside over the races. From the start, the crowd had been hurling insults at Justinian. By the end of the day, at race 22, the partisan chants had changed from \"Blue\" or \"Green\" to a unified Nίκα (\"Nika\", meaning \"Win!\" \"Victory!\" or \"Conquer!\"), and the crowds broke out and began to assault the palace. For the next five days, the palace was under siege.[citation needed] The fires that started during the tumult resulted in the destruction of much of the city, including the city\\'s foremost church, the Hagia Sophia (which Justinian would later rebuild). Some of the senators saw this as an opportunity to overthrow Justinian, as they were opposed to his new taxes and his lack of support for the nobility.[citation needed] The rioters, now armed and probably controlled by their allies in the Senate, also demanded that Justinian dismiss the prefect John the Cappadocian and the quaestor Tribonian. They then declared a new emperor, Hypatius, who was a nephew of former Emperor Anastasius I.[citation needed] Justinian, in despair, considered fleeing, but his wife Theodora is said to have dissuaded him, saying, \"Those who have worn the crown should never survive its loss. Never will I see the day when I am not saluted as empress.\" She is also credited with adding, \"[W]ho is born into the light of day must sooner or later die; and how could an Emperor ever allow himself to be a fugitive.\" Although an escape route across the sea lay open for the emperor, Theodora insisted that she would stay in the city, quoting an ancient saying, \"Royalty is a fine burial shroud,\" or perhaps, \"[the royal color] Purple makes a fine winding sheet.\" As Justinian rallied himself, he created a plan that involved Narses, a popular eunuch, as well as the generals Belisarius and Mundus. Carrying a bag of gold given to him by Justinian, the slightly built eunuch entered the Hippodrome alone and unarmed against a murderous mob that had already killed hundreds. Narses went directly to the Blues\\' section, where he approached the important Blues and reminded them that Emperor Justinian supported them over the Greens. He also reminded them that Hypatius, the man they crowned, was a Green. Then, he distributed the gold. The Blue leaders spoke quietly with each other and then they spoke to their followers. Then, in the middle of Hypatius\\' coronation, the Blues stormed out of the Hippodrome. The Greens sat, stunned. Then, Imperial troops led by Belisarius and Mundus stormed into the Hippodrome, killing any remaining rebels indiscriminately be they Blues or Greens. About thirty thousand rioters were reportedly killed. Justinian also had Hypatius executed and exiled the senators who had supported the riot. He then rebuilt Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia and was free to establish his rule.

From the start, the crowd had been hurling insults at Justinian. By the end of the day, at race 22, the partisan chants had changed from \"Blue\" or \"Green\" to a unified {{lang|grc|Nίκα}} (\\'\\'\"Nika\"\\'\\', meaning \"Win!\" \"Victory!\" or \"Conquer!\"), and the crowds broke out and began to assault the palace.

Carrying a bag of gold given to him by Justinian, the slightly built eunuch entered the Hippodrome alone and unarmed against a murderous mob that had already killed hundreds. Narses went directly to the Blues\\' section, where he approached the important Blues and reminded them that Emperor Justinian supported them over the Greens. He also reminded them that Hypatius, the man they crowned, was a Green. Then, he distributed the gold. The Blue leaders spoke quietly with each other and then they spoke to their followers. Then, in the middle of Hypatius\\' coronation, the Blues stormed out of the Hippodrome. The Greens sat, stunned. Then, Imperial troops led by Belisarius and Mundus stormed into the Hippodrome, killing any remaining rebels indiscriminately be they Blues or Greens.<ref name=\":0\" />\\n\\nAbout thirty thousand rioters were reportedly killed.<ref>This is the number given by Procopius, \\'\\'Wars\\'\\' ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/procop-wars1.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212112900/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/procop-wars1.html |date=2006-02-12 }}.)</ref> Justinian also had Hypatius executed and exiled the senators who had supported the riot.

       "  'first_paragraphs': 'Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879\\xa0– 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.\\nThe son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.\\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.\\nAlthough initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.\\nEinstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\"',\n",

       "  'first_paragraphs': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son.\\nA prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain.\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

       "     'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

[[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.

Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W.

Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others.

Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n\\nThe port city now known as [[Le Havre]] was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]], whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named \\'\\'Franciscopolis\\'\\' after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\\n\\n====Americas====\\n{{further|France-Americas relations}}\\nIn 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of [[Lyon]] in financing the expedition of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to North America.

The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.<ref>R. J.

Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the [[Waldensians]], at the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.\\n\\n===Death===\\nFrancis died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cavendish|first1=Richard|title=The Marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots {{!}} History Today|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/marriage-mary-queen-scots|website=www.historytoday.com}}</ref> He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in [[Saint Denis Basilica]].

Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian [[Jules Michelet]] set the negative image.<ref>Robert J. Knecht, \"\\'Born between two women...\\'Jules Michelet and Francis I.\" \\'\\'Renaissance Studies\\'\\' (2000) 14#3: 329-343 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24412871 online]</ref>\\n\\nFrancis\\' personal emblem was the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] and his Latin motto was \\'\\'Nutrisco et extinguo\\'\\' (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\").<ref>Richardson, 2015.</ref> His long nose earned him the nickname \\'\\'François du Grand Nez\\'\\' (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as \\'\\'le Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (\"the Knight-King\") or the \\'\\'le Roi-Guerrier\\'\\' (\"the Warrior-King\").<ref>[[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] [https://archive.is/20130213110523/http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Laroussefr_-_Article/11020086]</ref>\\n\\nBritish historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:\\n:He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]]. The couple had seven children:\\n* Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] almost from birth until death.\\n* [[Charlotte of Valois|Charlotte]] (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] from 1518 until death.\\n* [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless.\\n* [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559).

The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was [[Françoise de Foix]], Countess of [[Châteaubriant]]. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly [[Mary Boleyn]], mistress of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450</ref>\\n\\n==Francis I in films, stage and literature==\\nThe amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by [[Fanny Kemble]], \\'\\'Francis the First\\'\\', and the 1832 play by [[Victor Hugo]], \\'\\'[[Le Roi s\\'amuse]]\\'\\' (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester [[Triboulet]], the inspiration for the 1851 opera \\'\\'[[Rigoletto (opera)|Rigoletto]]\\'\\' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].\\n\\nFrancis was first played in a [[George Méliès]] movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), [[Aimé Simon-Girard]] (1937), [[Sacha Guitry]] (1937), [[Gérard Oury]] (1953), [[Jean Marais]] (1955), [[Pedro Armendáriz]] (1956), [[Claude Titre]] (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). [[Timothy West]] (1998) and [[Emmanuel Leconte]] (2007– 2010).\\n\\nFrancis was portrayed by [[Peter Gilmore]] in the comedy film \\'\\'[[Carry On Henry]]\\'\\' charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis).\\n\\nFrancis receives a mention in a minor story in [[Laurence Sterne]]\\'s novel \\'\\'[[Tristram Shandy]]\\'\\'. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\\n\\nHe is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel \\'\\'Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé\\'\\', where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\\n\\nHe often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – [[Mary Boleyn]] (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels \\'\\'The Lady in the Tower\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],\\'\\' \\'\\'The Last Boleyn\\'\\', \\'\\'Dear Heart, How Like You This?\\'\\' and \\'\\'Mademoiselle Boleyn\\'\\' feature Francis in their story. He appears in [[Hilary Mantel]]\\'s \\'\\'Wolf Hall\\'\\' about Henry VIII\\'s minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] and is often referred to in its sequel, \\'\\'Bring Up the Bodies\\'\\'.\\n\\nFrancis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel \\'\\'Courtesan\\'\\' about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.\\n\\nFrancis appears as the patron of [[Benvenuto Cellini]] in the 1843 French novel \\'\\'L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio\\'\\' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].\\n\\n[[Samuel Shellabarger]]\\'s novel \\'\\'The King\\'s Cavalier\\'\\' describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.\\n\\nHe was a recurring character in the Showtime series \\'\\'[[The Tudors]]\\'\\', opposite [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte.\\n\\nHe and his court set the scene for [[Friedrich Schiller]]\\'s ballad \\'\\'[[Der Handschuh]]\\'\\' (\\'\\'The Glove\\'\\').\\n\\nFrancis I (played by [[Timothy West]]) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by [[Dougray Scott]]) are central figures in the 1998 movie \\'\\'[[Ever After]]\\'\\', a retelling of the [[Cinderella]] story.  The plot includes [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (played by [[Patrick Godfrey]]) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\'.\\n\\nHe is played by [[Alfonso Bassave]] in the [[Televisión Española|TVE]] series \\'\\'[[Carlos, rey emperador]]\\'\\', opposite [[Álvaro Cervantes]] as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].\\n\\n==Ancestors==\\n{{ahnentafel\\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\\n| 1 = 1. \\'\\'\\'Francis I of France\\'\\'\\'\\n| 2 = 2.

      "Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father's cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne's death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building's design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis's reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano's letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French] Lily and the [Ottoman] Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther's preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther's theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice's allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor's 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended .... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry's future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s'amuse (\"The King's Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne's novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète's novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall about Henry VIII's minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger's novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger's novel The King's Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller's ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis's son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis's court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

      "By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (known in France as ''La Joconde''), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture.

      "Francis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[Book of the Courtier]]'', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\n",

      "In 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.

Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the ''[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]'') for Paris in order to have control over the building's design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\n",

      "Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the military activity of Francis's reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis' kingdom.\n",

He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid.

This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII.

      "Francis' personal emblem was the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] and his Latin motto was ''Nutrisco et extinguo'' (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\").<ref>Richardson, 2015.</ref> His long nose earned him the nickname ''François du Grand Nez'' (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as ''le Roi-Chevalier'' (\"the Knight-King\") or the ''le Roi-Guerrier'' (\"the Warrior-King\").<ref>[[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] [https://archive.is/20130213110523/http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Laroussefr_-_Article/11020086]</ref>\n",

      "British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:\n",
      ":He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\n",

      "==Marriage and issue==\n",
      "On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]]. The couple had seven children:\n",

The first was [[Françoise de Foix]], Countess of [[Châteaubriant]]. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly [[Mary Boleyn]], mistress of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and sister of Henry's future wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450</ref>\n",

      "\n",
      "He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète's novel ''Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé'', where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\n",

Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels ''The Lady in the Tower'', ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],'' ''The Last Boleyn'', ''Dear Heart, How Like You This?'' and ''Mademoiselle Boleyn'' feature Francis in their story. He appears in [[Hilary Mantel]]'s ''Wolf Hall'' about Henry VIII's minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] and is often referred to in its sequel, ''Bring Up the Bodies''.\n",

      "Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\n"

       "    'extract': '<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Francis I</b> (French: <i lang=\"fr\">François I<sup>er</sup></i>; Middle French: <i lang=\"frm\">Francoys</i>; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son.\\n</p><p>A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the <i>Mona Lisa</i> with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.\\n</p><p>For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as <i>le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres</i> (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as <i>François au Grand Nez</i> (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the <i>Grand Colas</i>, and the <i>Roi-Chevalier</i> (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain.\\n</p><p>Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2><span id=\"Early_life_and_accession\">Early life and accession</span></h2>\\n<p><b>Francis of Orléans</b> was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine.  Today the town lies in the department of Charente.\\n</p><p>Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois.</p><p>In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Reign\">Reign</span></h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named <i>Grand Aumônier de France</i>) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Patron_of_the_arts\">Patron of the arts</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun.\\n</p><p>Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (known in France as <i>La Joconde</i>), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Man_of_letters\">Man of letters</span></h3>\\n<p>Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s <i>Book of the Courtier</i>, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n</p><p>In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the <i>Heptameron</i>.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Construction\">Construction</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Military_action\">Military action</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519.  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n</p><p>Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.</p><p>Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". <i>Zuppa alla Pavese</i> was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.</p><p>Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI.  Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.</p>\\n\\n<p>Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.</p><p>After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Relations_with_the_New_World_and_Asia\">Relations with the New World and Asia</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"</p><p>In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n</p><p>The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named <i>Franciscopolis</i> after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\\n</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Americas\">Americas</span></h4>\\n\\n<p>In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the <i>Cèllere Codex</i>.</p><p>In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil.</p><p>In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\"\\n</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Far_East_Asia\">Far East Asia</span></h4>\\n\\n\\n<p>French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the <i>Sacre</i> and the <i>Pensée</i>, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz.</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Ottoman_Empire\">Ottoman Empire</span></h4>\\n\\n<p>Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice.\\n</p><p>In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Bureaucratic_reform_and_language_policy\">Bureaucratic reform and language policy</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539.</p><p>In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Religious_policies\">Religious policies</span></h3>\\n<p>Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert.</p><p>Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.</p><p>Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Death\">Death</span></h3>\\n<p>Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II.\\n</p><p>Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Image_and_reputation\">Image and reputation</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image.</p><p>Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was <i>Nutrisco et extinguo</i> (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname <i>François du Grand Nez</i> (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as <i>le Roi-Chevalier</i> (\"the Knight-King\") or the <i>le Roi-Guerrier</i> (\"the Warrior-King\").</p><p>British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:\\n</p>\\n<dl><dd>He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.</dd></dl><h2><span id=\"Marriage_and_issue\">Marriage and issue</span></h2>\\n<p>On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany.

The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Francis_I_in_films.2C_stage_and_literature\"></span><span id=\"Francis_I_in_films,_stage_and_literature\">Francis I in films, stage and literature</span></h2>\\n<p>The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, <i>Francis the First</i>, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, <i>Le Roi s\\'amuse</i> (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera <i>Rigoletto</i> by Giuseppe Verdi.\\n</p><p>Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990).

The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\\n</p><p>He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel <i>Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé</i>, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\\n</p><p>He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels <i>The Lady in the Tower</i>, <i>The Other Boleyn Girl,</i> <i>The Last Boleyn</i>, <i>Dear Heart, How Like You This?</i> and <i>Mademoiselle Boleyn</i> feature Francis in their story.
