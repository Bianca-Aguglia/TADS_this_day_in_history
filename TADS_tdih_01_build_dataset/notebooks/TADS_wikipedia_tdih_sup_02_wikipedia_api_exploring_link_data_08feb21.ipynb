       "     'text': 'Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years is a literary hoax by Misha Defonseca, first published in 1997. The book was fraudulently published as a memoir telling the supposed true story of how the author survived the Holocaust as a young Jewish girl, wandering Europe searching for her deported parents. The book sold well in several countries and was made into a movie, Survivre avec les loups (Surviving with the Wolves), named after the claim that Misha was adopted by a pack of wolves during her journey who protected her. However, on 29 February 2008, Defonseca publicly admitted what many had already suspected, that her book was false. Her real name was Monique de Wael; while her parents were in fact taken away by the Nazis, they were not Jews but Roman Catholic members of the Belgian Resistance, and she did not leave her home during the war, as the book claims. In a statement released through her lawyers to the Brussels newspaper Le Soir, de Wael attempted to defend the hoax, claiming that the story of \"Misha\" \"is not actual reality, but was my reality, my way of surviving\" and that there were moments when she \"found it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was part of my imagination.\" It is difficult to be sure of de Wael\\'s true history, since it was obscured for so long behind the falsehood she told. However, at least a fragmentary version can be put together from documentation turned up by researchers and from de Wael\\'s own admissions. Monique de Wael was born in 1937 in Etterbeek, Belgium, to Robert De Wael and Josephine Donvil. Sources differ as to her birthdate: May 12 (according to a baptismal record) or September 2 (according to records from the school Monique attended in the year 1943–44.) Her family was Catholic, and her parents were members of the Belgian resistance, which led to them being arrested by the Nazis on September 23, 1941. Nazi records indicate that Robert de Wael was executed on May 3 or 4 of 1944, and Donvil died sometime between February 1 and December 31 of 1945. According to de Wael\\'s February 2008 statement, her guardianship went first to her grandfather Ernest de Wael, and then to her uncle Maurice de Wael. De Wael says that with the exception of her grandfather, those who took her in treated her badly, including calling her \"the traitor\\'s daughter\" because her father was suspected of having given information under torture in St. Gilles prison. She remained with her uncle\\'s family, and did not go off in search of her missing parents as \"Misha\" did, but according to her statement, this time with her uncle\\'s family was when she began to \"feel Jewish\" and to fantasize about going off with the wolves. By the late 1980s, de Wael was living in Massachusetts in the United States under the name Misha Defonseca. She was telling people the fictional story of Misha as a recollection of her own life, and presented it to the congregation of a Holliston, Massachusetts, synagogue on Holocaust Memorial Day as her own experience of the Holocaust. The character of Misha is eight when her parents are taken away (unlike de Wael, who was four). Before their deportation, her parents place her with a Roman Catholic family, who give her the pseudonym Monique de Wael (the author\\'s real name). When this family treats her cruelly, Misha goes off in search of her parents, walking through Europe and living by stealing food, clothing and shoes. At a time when she faces starvation in a forest, she is adopted by wolves, becoming a feral child. Protected by the pack, she survives by eating offal and worms. All in all, she treks over 1,900 miles (3,100 kilometers) through Europe, from Belgium to the Ukraine, through the Balkans and Germany and Poland (where she sneaks in and out of the Warsaw Ghetto), to Italy by boat and back to Belgium through France. Before the war is over, the character has taken human life to survive, stabbing to death with a pocket knife a rapist Nazi soldier who attacks her. When Jane Daniel, the owner of a small publishing company, Mt. Ivy Press, heard of Misha\\'s dramatic and supposedly true story, she signed Defonseca to write a memoir of her experiences, with Vera Lee, a friend of Daniel\\'s, as co-writer. The book was published in April 1997, and sold only around 5,000 copies in the United States, but was optioned for a film by The Walt Disney Company. Disney declined to make the film, however, in part because of legal difficulties: by 1998, Defonseca and Lee had brought a lawsuit against Daniel, alleging that she had failed to market the book properly in the U.S. and had failed to give the co-authors their proper share of overseas royalties. In 2001 a jury awarded Defonseca and Lee over $10 million. A judge\\'s decision later tripled the amount Daniel was required to pay to over $32 million, with $22.5 million to go to Defonseca and $11 million to Lee. The rights to the book were also awarded to Defonseca. Defonseca\\'s contract with Daniel and Mt. Ivy Press did not include the European print and film rights, which were sold separately. The book became a bestseller in France, selling more than 30,000 copies, and Defonseca toured France to promote it; in Italy the book sold even better, surpassing 37,000 copies. French film rights were sold to French, Jewish filmmaker Véra Belmont and the resulting movie, Survivre avec des loups, opened in Belgium in late 2007. Doubts about the truthfulness of the book surfaced even before the book was published. At least two people who were asked by the publisher to contribute blurbs for the book instead warned the publisher that the story was not true. One of them, Lawrence L. Langer (a 1991 winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, for his book Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory) consulted Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg, who also thought the story impossible. A third, Bette Greene, asked for her blurb to be removed because she found the book unbelievable. As early as 1996, questions of authenticity were being aired publicly, for instance by Henryk M. Broder in Der Spiegel: \"Falsehood or not a falsehood, that is the question here. Aside from [the existence of a compass allegedly used by Misha] no objective proof exists. And all witnesses who could confirm Misha\\'s story are either dead or disappeared.\" Even Defonseca\\'s co-author Lee had doubts, leading her to consult Facing History and Ourselves, a nonprofit educational organization which helps to guide how the Holocaust is studied in schools. According to Lee, when the organization\\'s representative told her that the story she was describing was impossible, she tried to bring her concerns to Daniel, only to be rebuffed. When she was told that Defonseca had burned diaries from her teens in which she had written down her story, because the French version of her book had told her story so completely, Lee was surprised because she had never been told of the existence of these diaries, much less been given access to them to assist in writing the book. Nevertheless, Lee would profess surprise in 2008 when Defonseca confessed that she was not Jewish and the story was fictional, saying that no research she did had led her to think the story was anything but true. As the publisher of the book, Daniel had made many public statements which addressed the issue of whether Defonseca\\'s memoir was truthful. One of these public statements came in 1999, and was prompted by the public controversy that occurred when Binjamin Wilkomirski\\'s alleged Holocaust memoir Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood 1939–1948 was shown to be a fraud. Daniel wrote \"Is Misha\\'s story fact or invention? Without hard evidence one way or the other, questions will always remain ... It is left to the reader to decide.\" Later, after the first jury award, Daniel would say \"I have no idea whether [Misha\\'s story] is true or not. My experience is that all Holocaust stories are far-fetched. All survivor stories are miracles.\" By 2007, however, Daniel was trying to actively debunk the story of Misha in hopes that it would provide a way to challenge the judgement against her. In August 2007, Daniel began a blog titled \"Best-Seller\", telling the story of how the book came to be published, and attracted attention from Sharon Sergeant, a genealogist. Using clues from the various versions of the manuscript, including the \"pseudonym\" of Monique de Wael, Sergeant turned up documents from de Wael\\'s life, such as a baptismal record and a school register showing de Wael enrolled in elementary school in 1943 when Misha was supposed to be wandering through Europe. After Daniel published these documents on the blog in late February 2008, the Belgian newspaper Le Soir took up the controversy, unearthing and publishing more detail on de Wael\\'s parents. Within a week, Defonseca had acknowledged that Monique de Wael was her real name and that the life of Misha was a fantasy.

The book was fraudulently published as a [[memoir]] telling the supposed true story of how the author survived [[the Holocaust]] as a young [[Jewish]] girl, wandering Europe searching for her deported parents. The book sold well in several countries and was made into a movie, \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Survivre avec les loups\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'Surviving with the Wolves\\'\\'), named after the claim that Misha was adopted by a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] during her journey who protected her.\\n\\nHowever, on 29 February 2008, Defonseca publicly admitted what many had already suspected, that her book was false. Her real name was Monique de Wael; while her parents were in fact taken away by the [[Nazis]], they were not Jews but [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] members of the [[Belgian Resistance]], and she did not leave her home during the [[World War II|war]], as the book claims. In a statement released through her lawyers to the [[Brussels]] newspaper \\'\\'[[Le Soir]]\\'\\', de Wael attempted to defend the [[hoax]], claiming that the story of \"Misha\" \"is not actual reality, but was my reality, my way of surviving\" and that there were moments when she \"found it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was part of my imagination.\"<ref name=\"statement\">{{cite web|url=http://lesoir.be/channels/cinema/exclusif-2008-02-28-580849.shtml|title=Defonseca\\'s statement to \\'\\'Le Soir\\'\\'|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203827/http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/exclusif-2008-02-28-580849.shtml|archivedate=2008-03-02}}</ref>\\n\\n==The real author, Monique de Wael==\\n{{Main|Misha Defonseca}}\\nIt is difficult to be sure of de Wael\\'s true history, since it was obscured for so long behind the falsehood she told.

De Wael says that with the exception of her grandfather, those who took her in treated her badly, including calling her \"the traitor\\'s daughter\" because her father was suspected of having given information under [[torture]] in St. Gilles prison.<ref name=\"Eskin\" /> She remained with her uncle\\'s family, and did not go off in search of her missing parents as \"Misha\" did, but according to her statement, this time with her uncle\\'s family was when she began to \"feel Jewish\" and to fantasize about going off with the wolves.<ref name=\"statement\" />\\n\\n==The book==\\nBy the late 1980s, de Wael was living in [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]] under the name \\'\\'Misha Defonseca\\'\\'. She was telling people the fictional story of Misha as a recollection of her own life, and presented it to the congregation of a [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], [[synagogue]] on [[Holocaust Memorial Day]] as her own experience of the Holocaust.\\n\\nThe character of Misha is eight when her parents are taken away (unlike de Wael, who was four). Before their deportation, her parents place her with a Roman Catholic family, who give her the pseudonym \\'\\'Monique de Wael\\'\\' (the author\\'s real name). When this family treats her cruelly, Misha goes off in search of her parents, walking through Europe and living by stealing food, clothing and shoes.\\n\\nAt a time when she faces starvation in a forest, she is adopted by wolves, becoming a [[feral child]]. Protected by the pack, she survives by eating [[offal]] and worms.<ref name=\"Haaretz\">\"[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/947275.html Holocaust: A children\\'s version]\".

Before the war is over, the character has taken human life to survive, stabbing to death with a pocket knife a rapist Nazi soldier who attacks her.<ref name=\"Incredible\">\"[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2001/10/31/incredible_journey/?page=full Incredible Journey]\". Boston Globe, 2001-10-31.</ref>\\n\\nWhen Jane Daniel, the owner of a small publishing company, Mt. Ivy Press, heard of Misha\\'s dramatic and supposedly true story, she signed Defonseca to write a memoir of her experiences, with [[Vera Lee]], a friend of Daniel\\'s, as co-writer. The book was published in April 1997, and sold only around 5,000 copies in the United States, but was optioned for a film by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Disney declined to make the film, however, in part because of legal difficulties:<ref name=\"Incredible\" /><ref name=\"Den of lies\">\"[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/03/01/den_of_lies/?page=full Den of lies]\". [[Boston Globe]], 2008-03-01.</ref> by 1998, Defonseca and Lee had brought a lawsuit against Daniel, alleging that she had failed to market the book properly in the U.S. and had failed to give the co-authors their proper share of overseas royalties. In 2001 a jury awarded Defonseca and Lee over $10 million. A judge\\'s decision later tripled the amount Daniel was required to pay to over $32 million, with $22.5 million to go to Defonseca and $11 million to Lee. The rights to the book were also awarded to Defonseca.<ref name=\"Den of lies\" /><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2008/02/29/writer_says_holocaust_memoir_not_true/ Writer Says Holocaust \\'Memoir\\' Not True], February 29, 2008</ref>\\n\\nDefonseca\\'s contract with Daniel and Mt. Ivy Press did not include the European print and film rights, which were sold separately. The book became a bestseller in France, selling more than 30,000 copies, and Defonseca toured France to promote it; in Italy the book sold even better, surpassing 37,000 copies.<ref name=\"Incredible\" /> French film rights were sold to French, Jewish filmmaker [[Véra Belmont]] and the resulting movie, \\'\\'Survivre avec des loups\\'\\', opened in Belgium in late 2007.\\n\\n==Exposure==\\nDoubts about the truthfulness of the book surfaced even before the book was published. At least two people who were asked by the publisher to contribute [[blurb]]s for the book instead warned the publisher that the story was not true.<ref name=\"Eskin\" /> One of them, [[Lawrence L. Langer]] (a 1991 winner of the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism, for his book \\'\\'Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory\\'\\') consulted Holocaust scholar [[Raul Hilberg]], who also thought the story impossible.<ref name=\"Incredible\" /> A third, [[Bette Greene]], asked for her blurb to be removed because she found the book unbelievable.<ref name=\"Life in Pieces\">Eskin, Blake. \\'\\'A Life in Pieces: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski\\'\\', New York and London: Norton, 2002, {{ISBN|0-393-04871-3}}. pp. 197-8</ref> As early as 1996, questions of authenticity were being aired publicly, for instance by [[Henryk M.

According to Lee, when the organization\\'s representative told her that the story she was describing was impossible, she tried to bring her concerns to Daniel, only to be rebuffed.<ref name=\"Incredible\" /> When she was told that Defonseca had burned diaries from her teens in which she had written down her story, because the French version of her book had told her story so completely, Lee was surprised because she had never been told of the existence of these diaries, much less been given access to them to assist in writing the book.<ref name=\"Incredible\" /> Nevertheless, Lee would profess surprise in 2008 when Defonseca confessed that she was not Jewish and the story was fictional, saying that no research she did had led her to think the story was anything but true.<ref>\"[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/02/29/writer_says_holocaust_memoir_not_true/ Writer admits Holocaust book is not true]\", Boston Globe, February 29, 2008.</ref>\\n\\nAs the publisher of the book, Daniel had made many public statements which addressed the issue of whether Defonseca\\'s memoir was truthful. One of these public statements came in 1999, and was prompted by the public controversy that occurred when [[Binjamin Wilkomirski]]\\'s alleged Holocaust memoir \\'\\'Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood 1939–1948\\'\\' was shown to be a fraud. Daniel wrote \"Is Misha\\'s story fact or invention? Without hard evidence one way or the other, questions will always remain ...

       "    'extract': '<p><i><b>Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years</b></i> is a literary hoax by Misha Defonseca, first published in 1997. The book was fraudulently published as a memoir telling the supposed true story of how the author survived the Holocaust as a young Jewish girl, wandering Europe searching for her deported parents. The book sold well in several countries and was made into a movie, <i><b>Survivre avec les loups</b></i> (<i>Surviving with the Wolves</i>), named after the claim that Misha was adopted by a pack of wolves during her journey who protected her.\\n</p><p>However, on 29 February 2008, Defonseca publicly admitted what many had already suspected, that her book was false. Her real name was Monique de Wael; while her parents were in fact taken away by the Nazis, they were not Jews but Roman Catholic members of the Belgian Resistance, and she did not leave her home during the war, as the book claims. In a statement released through her lawyers to the Brussels newspaper <i>Le Soir</i>, de Wael attempted to defend the hoax, claiming that the story of \"Misha\" \"is not actual reality, but was my reality, my way of surviving\" and that there were moments when she \"found it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was part of my imagination.\"</p>',\n",

       "     'text': 'Queen Anne\\'s War (1702–1713) was the second in a series of French and Indian Wars fought in England\\'s Thirteen American Colonies; it took place during the reign of Anne, Queen of Great Britain. In Europe, it is generally viewed as the American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession; in the Americas, it is more commonly viewed as a standalone conflict. It is also known as the Third Indian War or as the Second Intercolonial War in France. The war broke out in 1701 and was primarily a conflict between French, Spanish and English colonists for control of the American continent while the War of the Spanish Succession was being fought in Europe, with each side allied to various Native American tribes. It was fought on four fronts: In the south, Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina attacked one another, and English colonists engaged French colonists based at Mobile, Alabama, with allied Indians on both sides. The southern war did not result in significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida and parts of southern Georgia, and destroying the network of Spanish missions in Florida. In New England, English colonists fought against French colonists and Indian forces in Acadia and Canada. Quebec City was repeatedly targeted by British colonial expeditions, and the Acadian capital Port Royal was captured in 1710. The French colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart British expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in what is now southern Maine. They executed raids in the Province of Massachusetts Bay (including Maine), most famously the Raid on Deerfield in 1704. In Newfoundland, English colonists based at St. John\\'s disputed control of the island with the French colonists of Plaisance. Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids on settlements. The French colonists successfully captured St. John\\'s in 1709, but the British colonists quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it. French privateers based in Acadia and Placentia captured many ships from New England\\'s fishing and shipping industries. Privateers took 102 prizes into Placentia, second only to Martinique in France\\'s American colonies. The naval conflict ended with the capture of Acadia (Nova Scotia). The Treaty of Utrecht ended the war in 1713, following a preliminary peace in 1712. France ceded the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland to Britain while retaining Cape Breton Island and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some terms were ambiguous in the treaty, and the concerns of various Indian tribes were not included, thereby setting the stage for future conflicts. When war broke out in Europe in 1701 following the death of King Charles II concerning who should succeed him to the Spanish throne, it was initially restricted to a few powers in Europe, but it widened in May 1702 when England declared war on Spain and France. Both the British and French wanted to keep their American colonies neutral, but they did not reach an agreement. But the American colonists had their own tensions which had been growing along the borders separating the French and English colonies, especially concerning boundaries and governing authority in the northern and southwestern frontiers of the English colonies, which stretched from the Province of Carolina in the south to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on Newfoundland and at Hudson Bay. The total population of the English colonies was about 250,000, with Virginia and New England dominating. The residents were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching as far as the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists knew little of the interior of the continent to the west of the Appalachians and south of the Great Lakes. This area was dominated by Indian tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated it. Spanish missionaries in La Florida had established a network of missions to convert the Indians to Roman Catholicism. The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indian population to whom they ministered has been estimated at 20,000. French explorers had located the mouth of the Mississippi River, and they established a small colonial presence at Fort Maurepas near Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1699. From there, they began to build trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the Choctaw, a large tribe whose enemies included the British-allied Chickasaw. All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of infectious diseases such as smallpox by early explorers and traders. The arrival of French colonists in the south threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides of the recently ended Nine Years\\' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic colonists of New Spain and the Protestant colonists along the coast. To the north, the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes. Newfoundland was the site of a British colony at St. John\\'s and a French colony at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks, which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts. The borders and boundaries remained uncertain between Acadia and New England despite battles along the border throughout King William\\'s War. New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay near Castine, Maine, which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William\\'s War. The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by Indians, primarily Abenaki and Iroquois, and the Hudson River–Lake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements. The Hudson Bay territories (also known as Prince Rupert\\'s Land) were not significantly fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson\\'s Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied for their return in the negotiations that ended this war. Military technology used in America was not as developed as in Europe. Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications at the start of the war, such as St. Augustine, Florida, Boston, Quebec City, and St. John\\'s, Newfoundland and Labrador, although Port Royal\\'s fortifications were completed early in the war. Some villages and settlements were protected by wooden palisades, but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with gun ports through which defenders could fire, and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below. Europeans and colonists were typically armed with smooth-bore muskets that had a maximum range of about 100 yards (91\\xa0m) but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance. Some colonists also carried pikes, while Indian warriors either carried arms supplied by the colonists or were armed with weapons such as primitive tomahawks and bows. A small number of colonists had training in the operation of cannon and other types of artillery which were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses. English colonists were generally organized into militia companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland. The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the troupes de la marine. This force consisted of some experienced officers and was manned by recruits sent over from France numbering between 500 and 1,200. They were spread throughout the territories of New France, with concentrations in the major population centers. Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indians in their territory and not to provide them with weapons. Florida held an estimated 8,000 Indians before the war, but this was reduced to 200 after English colonist raids made early in the war. Prominent French and English colonists understood at the turn of the 18th century that control of the Mississippi River would have a significant role in future development and trade, and each developed visionary plans to thwart the other\\'s activities. French Canadian explorer Pierre Le Moyne d\\'Iberville had developed a \"Project sur la Caroline\" in the aftermath of the previous war which called for establishing relationships with Indians in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English colonists off the continent, or at least limit them to coastal areas. In pursuit of this grand strategy, he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi (which had first been found by La Salle in 1670) and established Fort Maurepas in 1699. From this base and Fort Louis de la Mobile (founded in 1702), he began to establish relationships with the local Choctaw, Chickasaw, Natchez, and other tribes. English colonial traders and explorers from Carolina had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended all the way to the Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests. Iberville had approached the Spanish in January 1702 before the war broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola, Florida in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense at the head of the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force with some 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured. Carolina\\'s Governor Moore received notification concerning the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida. 500 English colonial soldiers and militia and 300 Indians captured and burned the town of St. Augustine, Florida in the Siege of St. Augustine (1702). The English were unable to take the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana. The Apalachee and Timucua of Spanish Florida were virtually wiped out in a raiding expedition by Moore that became known as the Apalachee massacre of 1704. Many of the survivors of these raids were relocated to the Savannah River where they were confined to reservations. Raids continued in the following years consisting of large Indian forces, sometimes including a small number of white men; this included major expeditions directed at Pensacola in 1707 and Mobile in 1709. The Muscogee (Creek), Yamasee, and Chickasaw were armed and led by English colonists, and they dominated these conflicts at the expense of the Choctaw, Timucua, and Apalachee. Throughout the war, New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy thwarted New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. In 1703, Michel Leneuf de la Vallière de Beaubassin commanded a few French Canadians and 500 Indians of the Wabanaki Confederacy, and they led attacks against New England settlements from Wells to Falmouth (Portland, Maine) in the Northeast Coast Campaign. They killed or captured more than 300 settlers. In February 1704, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville led 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga Indians and 50 French Canadians in a raid on Deerfield in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and destroyed the settlement, killing and capturing many colonists. More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, where most of the children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man. There was an active slave trade of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity. New England colonists were unable to effectively combat these raids, so they retaliated by launching an expedition against Acadia led by the famous American Indian fighter Benjamin Church. The expedition raided Grand Pré, Chignecto, and other settlements. French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia\\'s capital of Port Royal, but Church\\'s account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack. Father Sébastien Rale was widely suspected of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. In the winter of 1705, Massachusetts dispatched 275 militiamen under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church. French and Wabanaki Confederacy continued making raids in northern Massachusetts in 1705, against which the New England colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while leaders from New France and New England negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted until the end of the war, sometimes with French participation. In May 1707, Governor Dudley organized an expedition to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported that two-thirds of the fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out. In October 1710, 3,600 British and colonial forces led by Francis Nicholson finally captured Port Royal after a siege of one week. This ended official French control of the peninsular portion of Acadia (present-day mainland Nova Scotia), although resistance continued until the end of the war. Resistance by the Wabanaki Confederation continued in the 1711 Battle of Bloody Creek and raids along the Maine frontier. The remainder of Acadia (present-day eastern Maine and New Brunswick) remained disputed territory between New England and New France. The French in New France\\'s heartland of Canada opposed attacking the Province of New York. They were reluctant to arouse the Iroquois, whom they feared more than they did the British colonists and with whom they had made the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. New York merchants were opposed to attacking New France because it would interrupt the lucrative Indian fur trade, much of which came through New France. The Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict, despite Peter Schuyler\\'s efforts to interest them in the war. (Schuyler was Albany\\'s commissioner of Indians.) Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch organized an ambitious assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical support from the queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached the southern end of Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson\\'s successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711. The plan for 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks, but its execution was a disaster. A fleet of 15 ships of the line and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June, doubling the town\\'s population and greatly straining the colony\\'s ability to provide necessary provisions. The expedition sailed for Quebec at the end of July, but a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog. More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called off the expedition. In the meantime, Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland but had only reached Lake George when word reached him of Walker\\'s disaster, and he also turned back. In this expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English colonists, but they simultaneously sent warnings to the French about the expedition, effectively playing both sides of the conflict. Newfoundland\\'s coast was dotted with small French and English communities, with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe. Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John\\'s on Conception Bay. During King William\\'s War, d\\'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696–97, and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance. During the winter of 1705, Plaisance\\'s French governor Daniel d\\'Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi\\'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John\\'s. The French and their Indian allies continued to harass the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at £188,000. The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island\\'s northern coasts. In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi\\'kmaq volunteers captured St. John\\'s and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John\\'s was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709. (The same French expedition also tried to take Ferryland, but it successfully resisted.) English fleet commanders contemplated attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 but did not make them, the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence. In 1712, Britain and France declared an armistice, and a final peace agreement was signed the following year. Under terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained Acadia (which they renamed Nova Scotia), sovereignty over Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay region, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. France recognized British suzerainty over the Iroquois and agreed that commerce with American Indians farther inland would be open to all nations. It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including Cape Breton Island, and retained fishing rights in the area, including rights to dry fish on the northern shore of Newfoundland. By the later years of the war, many Abenakis had tired of the conflict despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indian interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders. Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River and the establishment of government-run trading posts in their territory. The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713 by eight representatives of some of the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory. Over the next year, other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty, but no Mi\\'kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726. The loss of Newfoundland and Acadia restricted the French presence on the Atlantic to Cape Breton Island. French were resettled there from Newfoundland, creating the colony of Île-Royale, and France constructed the Fortress of Louisbourg in the following years. This presence plus the rights to use the Newfoundland shore resulted in continued friction between French and British fishing interests, which was not fully resolved until late in the 18th century. The economic effects of the war were severe in Newfoundland, with the fishing fleets significantly reduced. The British fishing fleet began to recover immediately after the peace was finalized, and they attempted to prevent Spanish ships from fishing in Newfoundland waters, as they previously had. However, many Spanish ships were simply reflagged with English straw owners to evade British controls. The British capture of Acadia had long-term consequences for the Acadians and Mi\\'kmaq living there. Britain\\'s hold on Nova Scotia was initially quite tenuous, a situation on which French and Mi\\'kmaq resistance leaders capitalized. British relations with the Mi\\'kmaq after the war developed in the context of British expansion in Nova Scotia and also along the Maine coast, where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands, often in violation of previous treaties. Neither the Abenakis nor the Mi\\'kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht, and the 1713 Portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by the New England signatories, so the Mi\\'kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands. This conflict was increased by French intriguers such as Sébastien Rale, and eventually they developed into Father Rale\\'s War (1722–1727). British relations were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French leaders such as Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi\\'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia. Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia\\'s borders. The boundaries were unclear as laid out by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula was included in the treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick. The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George\\'s War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years\\' War. Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on the front line of the war, yet the New England colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown\\'s military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition. Spanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population from the effects of the war, and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years\\' War. Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina\\'s viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina. James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois. The economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations. The French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico, renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish. Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out. The first Indian War was King Philip\\'s War, the second was King William\\'s War, and the fourth was Father Rale\\'s War.

The southern war did not result in significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida and parts of southern Georgia, and destroying the network of [[Spanish missions in Florida]].\\n# In [[New England]], English colonists fought against French colonists and Indian forces in [[Acadia]] and [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]. [[Quebec City]] was repeatedly targeted by British colonial expeditions, and the Acadian capital [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] was [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|captured in 1710]].

This area was dominated by Indian tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated it.

Newfoundland was the site of a British colony at [[St. John\\'s, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John\\'s]] and a French colony at [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance]], with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe.<ref>Drake, p. 115</ref> These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]) and Massachusetts.<ref>Pope, pp. 202–203<!--population figures--></ref><ref>Drake, p. 115,203</ref>\\n\\nThe borders and boundaries remained uncertain between [[Acadia]] and New England despite battles along the border throughout [[King William\\'s War]].

The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements.<ref>Drake, p. 150</ref>\\n\\nThe Hudson Bay territories (also known as [[Prince Rupert\\'s Land]]) were not significantly fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay.

Some colonists also carried pikes, while Indian warriors either carried arms supplied by the colonists or were armed with weapons such as primitive [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]] and bows.

French Canadian explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d\\'Iberville]] had developed a \"Project sur la Caroline\" in the aftermath of the previous war which called for establishing relationships with Indians in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English colonists off the continent, or at least limit them to coastal areas. In pursuit of this grand strategy, he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi (which had first been found by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] in 1670) and established Fort Maurepas in 1699.

The boundaries were unclear as laid out by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula was included in the treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern [[New Brunswick]].<ref name=Pec84>Peckham, p. 84</ref> The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during [[King George\\'s War]] in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the [[Seven Years\\' War]].<ref>See e.g. Parkman (1897) for the later history of British-Acadian conflict.</ref>\\n\\n===New England===\\n[[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were on the front line of the war, yet the [[New England]] colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of [[Boston]] as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown\\'s military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition.<ref name=Craven307_9>Craven, pp. 307–309</ref>\\n\\n===Southern colonies===\\nSpanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population from the effects of the war,<ref name=\"Weber, pp. 144–145\">Weber, pp. 144–145</ref> and it was ceded to Britain in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]] following the Seven Years\\' War.<ref>Weber, p. 199</ref> Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 [[Yamasee War]] that posed a major threat to South Carolina\\'s viability.<ref>Weber, p. 166</ref> The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the [[Province of Georgia]], which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina.<ref>Weber, p. 180</ref> James Moore took military action against the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscaroras]] of North Carolina in the [[Tuscarora War]] which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois.<ref name=Pk75>Peckham, p. 75</ref>\\n\\nThe economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], and [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily [[tobacco]]) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests.<ref>Craven, pp. 301–302</ref> [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]] accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.<ref name=Craven307_9/>\\n\\n===Trade===\\nThe French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected [[Fort Niagara]] in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of [[New Orleans]] in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled [[Spanish Texas|Texas]] and [[Spanish Florida|Florida]]. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico,<ref>Weber, p. 184</ref> renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish.<ref>Peckham, p. 82</ref> Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the [[Ohio River]] valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the [[French and Indian War]] broke out.<ref>Parkman (1897), pp. 133–150</ref>\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist|3}}\\n\\n==Sources==\\n{{Library resources box|onlinebooks=yes}}\\n{{refbegin|2}}\\n* {{cite journal |last1=Arnade |first1=Charles W |year=1962 |title=The English Invasion of Spanish Florida, 1700–1706  |journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly |volume=41|issue= 1, July |pages=29–37 |jstor=30139893 }}\\n* {{cite book|last=Bryce|first=George|title=The Remarkable History of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company|url=https://archive.org/details/remarkablehisto00brycgoog|publisher=S.

       "     'text': 'Abel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch:\\xa0[ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn]; 1603\\xa0– 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer, explorer, and merchant, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was the first known European explorer to reach the islands of Van Diemen\\'s Land (now Tasmania), Fiji and New Zealand. Abel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city. Employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Tasman sailed from Texel to Batavia, now Jakarta, in 1633 taking the southern Brouwer Route. During this period, Tasman took part in a voyage to Seram Island; the locals had sold spices to other European nationalities than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by people of Seram. In August 1637, Tasman was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the Jordaan, but the purchase was cancelled. He was second-in-command of a 1639 exploration expedition in the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast. The fleet included the ships Engel and Gracht and reached Fort Zeelandia (Dutch Formosa) and Deshima. In August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of Antonie van Diemen, Cornelis van der Lijn, Joan Maetsuycker, Justus Schouten, Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia despatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the Cape of Good Hope, west of Staten Land (near the Cape Horn of South America) and south of the Solomon Islands. One of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of \"all the totally unknown\" Provinces of Beach. This was a purported yet non-existent landmass alleged to have plentiful gold, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century, as a result of an error in some editions of Marco Polo\\'s works. The expedition was to use two small ships, Heemskerck and Zeehaen. In accordance with Visscher\\'s directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 and arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain\\'s journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds, Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island, both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November, snow and hail influenced the ship\\'s council to alter course to a more north-easterly direction, expecting to arrive one day at the Solomon Islands. On 24 November 1642, Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen\\'s Land, after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south, Tasman skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. He then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island, where he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later, on December 1, Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. On December 2, two ship\\'s boats under the command of the Pilot, Major Visscher, rowed through the Marion Narrows into Blackman Bay, and across the west to the outflow of Boomer Creek where they gathered some edible \"greens\". Tasman named Frederick Hendrik Bay, which included the present North Bay, Marion Bay and the inlet Blackman Bay (the name Frederick Henry Bay was mistakenly transferred to its present location by Marion Dufresne in 1772). The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough, the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land, on 3 December 1642. For two more days, he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. The impenetrable wind wall indicated that here was a strait, not a bay. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting. After some exploration, Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. The expedition endured an extremely rough voyage and in one of his diary entries Tasman credited his compass, claiming it was the only thing that had kept him alive. On 13 December 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island, New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to sight New Zealand. Tasman named it Staten Landt \"in honour of the States General\" (Dutch parliament). He wrote, \"it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Landt but it is uncertain\", referring to Isla de los Estados, a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, encountered by the Dutch navigator Jacob Le Maire in 1616. However, in 1643 Brouwer\\'s expedition to Valdivia found out that Staaten Landt was separated by sea from any the hypothetical Southern Land. Tasman continued: \"We believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown Southland.\" Tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined Terra Australis that stretched across the Pacific to near the southern tip of South America. After sailing north, then east for five days, the expedition anchored about 7\\xa0km from the coast off what is now believed to have been Golden Bay. Tasman sent ship\\'s boats to gather water, but one of his boats was attacked by Māori in a double-hulled waka (canoe) and four of his men were killed with mere (clubs). In the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore, two of which betook themselves towards us. When our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water, and with the sinking of the sun (which sank behind the high land) they had been still about half a mile from the shore. After our people had been on board about one glass, people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff, hollow voices. We could not in the least understand any of it; however, when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer. But they did not come nearer than a stone\\'s shot. They also blew many times on an instrument, which produced a sound like the moors\\' trumpets. We had one of our sailors (who could play somewhat on the trumpet) play some tunes to them in answer.\" As Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which \"eleven swarming with people came off towards us.\" The waka approached the Zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. Canister shot also hit the side of a waka. Archaeological research has shown the Dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori may have been trying to protect. Tasman named the area \"Murderers\\' Bay\". The expedition then sailed north, sighting Cook Strait, which it mistook for a bight and named \"Zeehaen\\'s Bight\". Two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of New Zealand still endure: Cape Maria van Diemen and Three Kings Islands. (Kaap Pieter Boreels was renamed Cape Egmont by Captain James Cook 125 years later.) En route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman\\'s ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia before making his way back into the open sea. The expedition turned north-west towards New Guinea and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643. Tasman left Batavia on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of New Holland. However, he missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on New Holland and its people. He arrived back in Batavia in August 1644. From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman\\'s explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman did not fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans – mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident. On 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now Thailand) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to Manila to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage. In his will (dating from 1657), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village Lutjegast. Although Tasman\\'s pilot, Frans Visscher, published Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land in 1642, Tasman\\'s detailed journal was not published until 1898; however, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers. Tasman\\'s ten-month voyage in 1642–43 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman\\'s suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769. Multiple places have been named after Tasman, including: the Australian island and state of Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen\\'s land. It includes features such as: the Tasman Peninsula the Tasman Bridge the Tasman Highway the Tasman Sea in New Zealand: the Tasman Glacier Tasman Lake the Tasman River Mount Tasman the Abel Tasman National Park Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere the Tasman District Also named after Tasman are: Tasman Pulp and Paper company, A large pulp and paper producer in Kawerau New Zealand Abel Tasman Drive, in Takaka The former passenger/vehicle ferry Abel Tasman The Able Tasmans – an indie band from Auckland, New Zealand Tasman, a layout engine for Internet Explorer 6594 Tasman (1987 MM1), a main-belt asteroid Tasman Drive in San Jose, California, and its Tasman light rail station Tasman Road in Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa HMNZS Tasman Shore based training Establishment of the Royal New Zealand Navy HMAS Tasman is a Hunter-class frigate that is expected to enter service with the Royal Australian Navy in the late 2020s. His portrait has been on four New Zealand postage stamp issues, on a 1992 5 NZD coin, and on 1963, 1966 and 1985 Australian postage stamps. In the Netherlands, many streets are named after him. In Lutjegast, the village he was born, there is a museum dedicated to his life and travels. Held within the collection of the State Library of New South Wales is the Tasman Map, thought to have been drawn by Isaac Gilsemans, or completed under the supervision of Franz Jacobszoon Visscher. The map is also known as the Bonaparte map, as it was once owned by Prince Roland Bonaparte, the great-nephew of Napoleon. The map was completed sometime after 1644 and is based on the original charts drawn during Tasman\\'s first and second voyages. As none of the journals or logs composed during Tasman\\'s second voyage have survived, the Bonaparte map remains as an important contemporary artefact of Tasman\\'s voyage to the northern coast of the Australian continent. The Tasman map largely reveals the extent of understanding the Dutch had of the Australian continent at the time. The map includes the western and southern coasts of Australia, accidentally encountered by Dutch voyagers as they journeyed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to the VOC headquarters in Batavia. In addition, the map shows the tracks of Tasman\\'s two voyages. Of his second voyage, the map shows the area of the Banda Islands, the southern coast of New Guinea and much of the northern coast of Australia. However, the area of the Torres Strait is shown unexamined; this is despite having been given orders by VOC Council at Batavia to explore the possibility of a channel between New Guinea and the Australian continent. There is debate as to the origin of the map. It is widely believed that the map was produced in Batavia; however, it has also been argued that the map was produced in Amsterdam. The authorship of the map has also been debated: while the map is commonly attributed to Tasman, it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration, probably involving Franchoijs Visscher and Isaack Gilsemans, who took part in both of Tasman\\'s voyages. Whether the map was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate, as a VOC company report in December 1644 suggests that at that time no maps showing Tasman\\'s voyages were yet complete. In 1943, a mosaic version of the map, composed of coloured marble and brass, was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the Mitchell Library in Sydney.

He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. However, he missed the [[Torres Strait]] between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] and its people.<ref name=Quanchi>Quanchi, \\'\\'Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands\\'\\', page 237</ref> He arrived back in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in August 1644.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of the [[Dutch East India Company]], Tasman\\'s explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman did not fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abel Tasman\\'s great voyage|url=http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=0x000ae4f7|publisher=Tai Awatea-Knowledge Net|access-date=14 September 2011}}</ref> For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans – mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.\\n\\n== Later life ==\\nOn 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now [[Thailand]]) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to [[Manila]] to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage. In his will (dating from 1657<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.nationaalarchief.nl/vitrine/wie_was_tasman.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420083101/http://www.nationaalarchief.nl/vitrine/wie_was_tasman.html|url-status=dead|title=National Archives|archive-date=20 April 2008}}</ref>), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village Lutjegast.<ref name=\"history-nz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.history-nz.org/discovery1.html |title=Abel Janszoon Tasman - New Zealand in History - Holland 1603 - 1659 |author=Robbie Whitmore|publisher=history-nz.org|access-date=31 August 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nAlthough Tasman\\'s pilot, Frans Visscher, published \\'\\'Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land\\'\\' in 1642, Tasman\\'s detailed journal was not published until 1898; however, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers.<ref name= Quanchi/>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nTasman\\'s ten-month voyage in 1642–43 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman\\'s suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around [[Tierra del Fuego]]. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=21–22}}</ref>\\n\\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}<!--need citations for things that are not obviously after him and those without articles-->\\n[[File:AbelTasmanNP.jpg|thumb|[[Abel Tasman National Park]]]]\\nMultiple places have been named after Tasman, including:\\n*the Australian island and state of [[Tasmania]], renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen\\'s land.

       "     'text': 'Christopher Columbus (/kəˈlʌmbəs/; between 25 August and 31 October 1451\\xa0– 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer and navigator who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, opening the way for European exploration and colonization of the Americas. His expeditions, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, were the first European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Scholars generally agree that Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language. He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years, but later took a Castilian mistress; he had one son with each woman. Though largely self-educated, Columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and history. He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade. Following Columbus\\'s persistent lobbying to multiple kingdoms, Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west. Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships, and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October (ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre-Columbian era). His landing place was an island in the Bahamas, known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani. Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola, establishing a colony in what is now Haiti. This was the first European settlement in the Americas since the Norse colonies begun some 500 years earlier. Columbus returned to Castile in early 1493, bringing a number of captured natives with him. Word of his voyages soon spread throughout Europe. Columbus made three further voyages to the New World, exploring the Lesser Antilles in 1493, Trinidad and the northern coast of South America in 1498, and the eastern coast of Central America in 1502. Many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use. He continued to seek a passage to the East Indies, and the extent to which he was aware that the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain. He never clearly renounced his belief that he had reached the Far East and gave the name indios (\"Indians\") to the indigenous peoples he encountered. As a colonial governor, Columbus was accused by his contemporaries of significant brutality and was soon removed from the post. Columbus\\'s strained relationship with the Crown of Castile and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500, and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown. Columbus\\'s expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, helping create the modern Western world. The transfers between the Old World and New World that followed his first voyage are known as the Columbian exchange. Columbus was widely venerated in the centuries after his death, but public perception has fractured in recent decades as scholars give greater attention to the harm committed under his governance, particularly the near-extermination of Hispaniola\\'s indigenous Taíno population from mistreatment and European diseases, as well as their enslavement. Proponents of the Black Legend theory of history claim that Columbus has been unfairly maligned as part of a wider anti-Catholic sentiment. Many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of Colombia and the District of Columbia. The name Christopher Columbus is the Anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus. His name in Ligurian is Cristoffa Corombo, in Italian Cristoforo Colombo, and in Spanish Cristóbal Colón. He was born between 25 August and 31 October 1451 in the territory of the Republic of Genoa (now part of modern Italy), though the exact location remains disputed. His father was Domenico Colombo, a wool weaver who worked both in Genoa and Savona and who also owned a cheese stand at which young Christopher worked as a helper. His mother was Susanna Fontanarossa. He had three brothers—Bartolomeo, Giovanni Pellegrino, and Giacomo (also called Diego), as well as a sister named Bianchinetta. His brother Bartolomeo worked in a cartography workshop in Lisbon for at least part of his adulthood. Columbus never wrote in his native language, which is presumed to have been a Genoese variety of Ligurian: his name in the 16th-century Genoese language would have been Cristoffa Corombo (Ligurian pronunciation:\\xa0[kriˈʃtɔffa kuˈɹuŋbu]). In one of his writings, he says he went to sea at the age of 10. In 1470, the Columbus family moved to Savona, where Domenico took over a tavern. In the same year, Christopher was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of René of Anjou to support his attempt to conquer the Kingdom of Naples. Some modern authors have argued that he was not from Genoa but, instead, from the Aragon region of Spain or from Portugal. These competing hypotheses have generally been discounted by mainstream scholars. In 1473, Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important Centurione, Di Negro and Spinola families of Genoa. Later, he allegedly made a trip to Chios, an Aegean island then ruled by Genoa. In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern Europe. He probably docked in Bristol, England, and Galway, Ireland. He may have also gone to Iceland in 1477. It is known that in the autumn of 1477, he sailed on a Portuguese ship from Galway to Lisbon, where he found his brother Bartolomeo, and they continued trading for the Centurione family. Columbus based himself in Lisbon from 1477 to 1485. He married Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, daughter of the Porto Santo governor and Portuguese nobleman of Lombard origin Bartolomeu Perestrello. In 1479 or 1480, his son Diego Columbus was born. Between 1482 and 1485, Columbus traded along the coasts of West Africa, reaching the Portuguese trading post of Elmina at the Guinea coast (in present-day Ghana). Before 1484, Columbus returned to Porto Santo to find that his wife had died. He returned to Portugal to settle her estate and take his son Diego with him. He left Portugal for Castile in 1485, where he found a mistress in 1487, a 20-year-old orphan named Beatriz Enríquez de Arana. It is likely that Beatriz met Columbus when he was in Córdoba, a gathering site of many Genoese merchants and where the court of the Catholic Monarchs was located at intervals. Beatriz, unmarried at the time, gave birth to Columbus\\'s natural son Fernando Columbus in July 1488, named for the monarch of Aragon. Columbus recognized the boy as his offspring. Columbus entrusted his older, legitimate son Diego to take care of Beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death, but Diego was negligent in his duties. Ambitious, Columbus eventually learned Latin, Portuguese, and Castilian. He read widely about astronomy, geography, and history, including the works of Claudius Ptolemy, Pierre Cardinal d\\'Ailly\\'s Imago Mundi, the travels of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville, Pliny\\'s Natural History, and Pope Pius II\\'s Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum. According to historian Edmund Morgan, Columbus was not a scholarly man. Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong ... Throughout his life, Columbus also showed a keen interest in the Bible and in Biblical prophecies, often quoting biblical texts in his letters and logs. For example, part of the argument that he submitted to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the Second Book of Esdras (Ezra): see 2 Esdras 6:42, which he took to mean that the Earth is made of six parts of land to one of water. Towards the end of his life, he produced a Book of Prophecies in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of Christian eschatology and of apocalypticism. Carol Delaney has argued that Columbus was a millennialist and that these beliefs motivated his quest for Asia in a variety of ways. Columbus wrote often about seeking gold in the diaries of his voyages and writes about acquiring the precious metal \"in such quantity that the sovereigns… will undertake and prepare to go conquer the Holy Sepulcher\". In an account of his fourth voyage, Columbus wrote that \"Jerusalem and Mount Sion must be rebuilt by Christian hands\". It has also been written that \"conversion of all people to the Christian faith\" is a central theme in Columbus\\'s writings which is a central tenet of some Millenarian beliefs. In a more specific identification of his motivations, Hamandi writes that the \"deliverance of Jerusalem from Muslim hands\" could be accomplished by \"using the resources of newly discovered lands\". Under the Mongol Empire\\'s hegemony over Asia (the Pax Mongolica, or Mongol peace), Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage, the Silk Road, to the Indies (then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia) and China, which were sources of valuable goods such as spices and silk. With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the land route to Asia was closed to Christian traders. Portuguese navigators tried to find a sea way to Asia. In 1470, the Florentine astronomer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli suggested to King Afonso V of Portugal that sailing west across the Atlantic would be a quicker way to reach the Spice Islands, Cathay, and Cipangu than the route around Africa, but Afonso rejected his proposal. In the 1480s, the Columbus brothers proposed a plan to reach the Indies by sailing west across the \"Ocean Sea\" (the Atlantic). By 1481, Toscanelli had sent Columbus a map implying that a westward route to Asia was possible. Columbus\\'s plans were complicated by the opening of the southeast passage to Asia around Africa by Bartolomeu Dias in 1488, when he reached the Cape of Good Hope (modern-day South Africa). Nearly all educated Westerners had understood, at least since the time of Aristotle, that the Earth is spherical. The sphericity of the Earth is also accounted for in the work of Ptolemy, on which medieval astronomy was largely based. In Columbus\\'s time, the techniques of celestial navigation, which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky, together with the understanding that the Earth is a sphere, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners. As far back as the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations. In the 1st century BC, Posidonius confirmed Eratosthenes\\'s results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations. These measurements were widely known among scholars, but Ptolemy\\'s use of the smaller, old-fashioned units of distance led Columbus to underestimate the size of the Earth by about a third. From Pierre d\\'Ailly\\'s Imago Mundi (1410) Columbus learned of Alfraganus\\'s estimate that a degree of latitude (or a degree of longitude along the equator) spanned 56\\u200b2⁄3 Arabic miles (equivalent to 66.2 nautical miles or 122.6 kilometres), but he did not realize that this was expressed in the Arabic mile (about 1,830 meters) rather than the shorter Roman mile (about 1,480 meters) with which he was familiar. Columbus therefore estimated the size of the Earth to be about 75% of Eratosthenes\\'s calculation, and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan as 2,400 nautical miles (about 23% of the real figure). Furthermore, most scholars accepted Ptolemy\\'s estimate that Eurasia spanned 180° longitude, rather than the actual 130° (to the Chinese mainland) or 150° (to Japan at the latitude of Spain). Columbus, for his part, believed an even higher estimate, leaving a smaller percentage for water. In d\\'Ailly\\'s Imago Mundi, Columbus read Marinus of Tyre\\'s estimate that the longitudinal span of Eurasia was 225°. Other people have suggested he followed Esdras\\'s statement that \"six parts [of the globe] are habitable and the seventh is covered with water.\" He was also aware of Marco Polo\\'s claim that Japan (which he called \"Cipangu\") was some 2,414 kilometres (1,500\\xa0mi) to the east of China (\"Cathay\"), and closer to the equator than it is. He was influenced by Toscanelli\\'s idea that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than Japan, including the mythical Antillia, which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the Azores. Columbus therefore would have estimated the distance from the Canary Islands west to Japan to be about 9,800 kilometres (5,300\\xa0nmi) or 3,700 kilometres (2,000\\xa0nmi), depending on which estimate he used for Eurasia\\'s longitudinal span. The true figure is now known to be vastly larger: about 20,000 kilometres (11,000\\xa0nmi). No ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable. Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The Catholic Monarchs, however, having completed an expensive war in the Iberian Peninsula, were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus\\'s project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage. Though Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds, which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called beating, during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted. Instead, Columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he was able to catch the \"westerlies\" that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe. There, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] It is unclear whether Columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others. The corresponding technique for efficient travel in the Atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the Volta do mar (\"turn of the sea\"). Columbus\\'s knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage. By sailing directly due west from the Canary Islands during hurricane season, skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a tropical cyclone, both of which, by chance, he avoided. By about 1484, Columbus proposed his planned voyage to King John II of Portugal. The king submitted Columbus\\'s proposal to his experts, who rejected it on the correct belief that Columbus\\'s estimate for a voyage of 2,400 nautical miles was only a quarter of what it should have been. Columbus traveled from Portugal to both Genoa and Venice, but he received encouragement from neither.[citation needed] In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, resulting in John II again inviting him for an audience. That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards Bartolomeu Dias returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the Cape of Good Hope). Columbus sought an audience from the monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, who had united several kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula by marrying and were ruling together. On 1 May 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. The savants of Spain, like their counterparts in Portugal, replied that Columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to Asia. They pronounced the idea impractical and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture. To keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the Catholic monarchs gave him an allowance, totaling about 14,000 maravedis for the year, or about the annual salary of a sailor. In May 1489, the queen sent him another 10,000 maravedis, and the same year the monarchs furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost. Columbus also dispatched his brother Bartholomew to the court of Henry VII of England to inquire whether the English crown might sponsor his expedition, but he was captured by pirates in the process, and only arrived in early 1491. By that time, Columbus had retreated to La Rábida Friary, where the Spanish crown sent him 20,000 maravedis to buy new clothes and instructions to return to the Spanish court for renewed discussions. Columbus waited at King Ferdinand\\'s camp until Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, in January 1492. A council led by Isabella\\'s confessor, Hernando de Talavera, found Columbus\\'s proposal to reach the Indies implausible. Columbus had left for France when Ferdinand intervened, first sending Talavera and Bishop Diego Deza to appeal to the queen. Isabella was finally convinced by the king\\'s clerk Luis de Santángel, who argued that Columbus would bring his ideas elsewhere, and offered to help arrange the funding. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch Columbus, who had travelled several kilometers toward Córdoba. In the April 1492 \"Capitulations of Santa Fe\", King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella promised Columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands he could claim for Spain. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity. Additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits. Columbus was later arrested in 1500 and dismissed from his posts. He and his sons, Diego and Fernando, then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the Castilian crown, known as the pleitos colombinos, alleging that the Crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to Columbus and his heirs. The Columbus family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego\\'s position as viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790. Between 1492 and 1504, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas, each voyage being sponsored by the Crown of Castile. On his first voyage, he independently discovered the Americas. These voyages marked the beginning of the European exploration and colonization of the Americas, and are thus important to both the Age of Discovery and Western history writ large. Columbus always insisted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the Asian continent, as previously described by Marco Polo and other European travelers. Columbus\\'s refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for Spain were not part of Asia might explain, in part, why the American continent was named after the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci and not after Columbus. On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three ships. The largest was a carrack, the Santa María, owned and captained by Juan de la Cosa, and under Columbus\\'s direct command. The other two were smaller caravels, nicknamed the Pinta (\\'painted one\\') and the Niña (\\'girl\\'), piloted by the Pinzón brothers (Martín Alonso and Vicente Yáñez, respectively). Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, which had been largely conquered by Castile. He restocked provisions and made repairs then departed from San Sebastián de La Gomera on 6 September, for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean. On 13 September 1492, Columbus observed that the needle of his compass no longer pointed to the North Star. It was once believed that Columbus had discovered magnetic declination, but it was later shown that the phenomenon was already known, both in Europe and in China. On 7 October, the crew spotted \"[i]mmense flocks of birds\". On 11 October, Columbus changed the fleet\\'s course to due west, and sailed through the night, believing land was soon to be found. At around 10:00 in the evening he thought he saw a light \"like a little wax candle rising and falling\". Four hours later, a lookout on the Pinta, Rodrigo de Triana, spotted land, and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout. Thereupon, the captain of the Pinta, Martín Alonso Pinzón, verified the sight of land and alerted Columbus by firing a lombard. Columbus later maintained that he had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by Ferdinand and Isabella to the first person to sight land. Columbus called this island (in what is now the Bahamas) San Salvador (meaning \"Holy Savior\"); the natives called it Guanahani. Columbus wrote of the indigenous people he first encountered in his journal entry of 12 October 1492: Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to San Salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can. I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves. They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them. I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion. If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language. Columbus called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited indios (Spanish for \"Indians\"). He initially encountered the Lucayan, Taíno, and Arawak peoples. Noting their gold ear ornaments, Columbus took some of the Arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold. Columbus noted that their primitive weapons and military tactics made the natives susceptible to easy conquest, writing, \"these people are very simple in war-like matters ... I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased.\" Columbus also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, where he landed on 28 October. On 22 November, Martín Alonso Pinzón took the Pinta on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called \"Babeque\" or \"Baneque\", which the natives had told him was rich in gold. Columbus, for his part, continued to the northern coast of Hispaniola, where he landed on 5 December. There, the Santa María ran aground on Christmas Day 1492 and had to be abandoned. The wreck was used as a target for cannon fire to impress the native peoples. Columbus was received by the native cacique Guacanagari, who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men, including the interpreter Luis de Torres, and founded the settlement of La Navidad, in present-day Haiti. Columbus took more natives prisoner and continued his exploration. He kept sailing along the northern coast of Hispaniola with a single ship, until he encountered Pinzón and the Pinta on 6 January. On 13 January 1493, Columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the New World, in the Bay of Rincón at the eastern end of the Samaná Peninsula in northeast Hispaniola. There he encountered the warlike Ciguayos, the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas. The Ciguayos refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that Columbus desired; in the ensuing clash one Ciguayo was stabbed in the buttocks and another wounded with an arrow in his chest. Because of these events, Columbus called the inlet the Bay of Arrows. Columbus headed for Spain on the Niña, but a storm separated him from the Pinta, and forced the Niña to stop at the island of Santa Maria in the Azores. Half of his crew went ashore to say prayers in a chapel to give thanks for having survived the storm. But while praying, they were imprisoned by the governor of the island, ostensibly on suspicion of being pirates. After a two-day standoff, the prisoners were released, and Columbus again set sail for Spain. Another storm forced him into the port at Lisbon. He anchored next to the King\\'s harbor patrol ship on 4 March 1493 in Portugal. There, he was interviewed by Bartolomeu Dias, who had rounded the Cape of Good Hope a few years earlier, in 1488–1489. Dias\\'s success had complicated Columbus\\'s attempts to secure funding from the Portuguese court because the sure route to the Indies that Dias pioneered made a risky, conjectural western route unnecessary. Not finding King John II of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for John\\'s reply. John asked Columbus to go to Vale do Paraíso north of Lisbon to meet him. Relations between Portugal and Castile were poor at the time. Columbus went to meet with John at Vale do Paraíso. Hearing of Columbus\\'s voyage, John told him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas. After spending more than a week in Portugal, and paying his respects to Eleanor of Viseu, Columbus again set sail for Spain. Ferdinand Magellan was a young boy and a ward of Eleanor\\'s court; it is likely he saw Columbus during this visit. Returning on 15 March 1493, Columbus was given a warm welcome by the monarchs. Word of his voyage rapidly spread throughout Europe. Most people initially believed that he had reached Asia. A series of papal orders laid the groundwork for how Spain and Portugal would divide the spoils of newly explored lands. Columbus left the port of Cádiz on 24 September 1493, with a fleet of 17 ships carrying 1,200 men and the supplies to establish permanent colonies in the New World. The passengers included priests, farmers, and soldiers, who would be the new colonists. This reflected the new policy of creating not just \"colonies of exploitation\", but also \"colonies of settlement\" from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to Christianity. Modern studies suggest that \"crew members may have included free black Africans who arrived in the New World about a decade before the slave trade began\". As in the first voyage, the fleet stopped at the Canary Islands, from which it departed on 13 October, following a more southerly course than on the previous expedition. On 3 November, Columbus sighted a rugged island that he named Dominica (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at Marie-Galante, which he named Santa María la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Los Santos, \"The Saints\"), he arrived at the island of Guadeloupe, which he named Santa María de Guadalupe de Extremadura, after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of Villuercas, in Guadalupe, Cáceres, Spain. He explored that island from 4 to 10 November. Michele da Cuneo, Columbus\\'s childhood friend from Savona, sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: \"In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral.\" Columbus named the small island of \"Saona\\xa0... to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona.\" Pedro de las Casas, father of the priest Bartolomé de las Casas, also accompanied Columbus on this voyage. The exact course of Columbus\\'s voyage through the Lesser Antilles is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including: Montserrat (for Santa María de Montserrat, after the Blessed Virgin of the Monastery of Montserrat, which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Spain), Antigua (after a church in Seville, Spain, called Santa María la Antigua, meaning \"Old St. Mary\\'s\"), Redonda (Santa María la Redonda, Spanish for \"St. Mary the Round\", owing to the island\\'s shape), Nevis (derived from the Spanish Nuestra Señora de las Nieves, \"Our Lady of the Snows\", because Columbus thought the clouds over Nevis Peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain), Saint Kitts (for St. Christopher, patron of sailors and travelers), Sint Eustatius (for the early Roman martyr, St. Eustachius), Saba (after the Biblical Queen of Sheba), Saint Martin (San Martín), and Saint Croix (from the Spanish Santa Cruz, meaning \"Holy Cross\"). Columbus also sighted the chain of the Virgin Islands, which he named Islas de Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes, \"Islands of Saint Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins\" (shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to Islas Vírgenes). He also named the islands of Virgin Gorda (\"Fat Virgin\"), Tortola, and Peter Island (San Pedro). One of the first skirmishes between Native Americans and Europeans since the time of the Vikings occurred on 14 November, when at Saint Croix, Columbus\\'s men pursued the canoe of some Island Caribs and their prisoners, which met them with arrows. At least one European was fatally wounded, and all of the inhabitants of the canoe were killed or captured. Michele da Cuneo, who took part in the battle, reported that Columbus let him keep one of the captured women, whom he beat and raped. Columbus continued to the Virgin Islands, and landed in Puerto Rico, which he named San Juan Bautista in honor of Saint John the Baptist (a name that was later given to the capital city of San Juan). Here, on 19 November, the Europeans rescued some women from a group of at least 20 that the local Caribs had been keeping as sex slaves. The women explained that any male captives were eaten, and that their own male offspring were castrated and made to serve the Caribs until they were old enough to be considered good to eat. The Europeans rescued three of these boys. On 22 November, Columbus returned to Hispaniola, where he intended to visit the fort of La Navidad. Columbus found the fort in ruins, destroyed by the Taínos. Among the ruins were the corpses of 11 of the 39 Spaniards who had stayed behind as the first colonists in the New World. Columbus then sailed more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) eastwards along the northern coast of Hispaniola, establishing a new settlement, which he called La Isabela, in the present-day Dominican Republic. However, La Isabela proved to be poorly located and the settlement was short-lived. In 1494, Columbus sent Alonso de Ojeda (whom a contemporary described as \"always the first to draw blood wherever there was a war or quarrel\") to Cibao (where gold was being mined for), which resulted in Ojeda\\'s capturing several natives on an accusation of theft. Ojeda cut the ears off of one native, and sent the others to La Isabela in chains, where Columbus ordered them to be decapitated. During his brief reign, Columbus executed Spanish colonists for minor crimes, and used dismemberment as another form of punishment. By the end of 1494, disease and famine had claimed two-thirds of the Spanish settlers. A native Nahuatl account depicted the social breakdown that accompanied the epidemic: \"A great many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger. They could not get up to search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds.\" By 1494, Columbus had shared his viceroyship with one of his military officers named Margarit, ordering him to prioritize Christianizing the natives, but that part of their noses and ears should be cut off for stealing. Margarit\\'s men exploited the natives by beating, raping and enslaving them, with none on Hispaniola being baptized for another two years. Columbus\\'s brother Diego warned Margarit to follow the admiral\\'s orders, which provoked him to take three caravels back to Spain. Fray Buil, who was supposed to perform baptisms, accompanied Margarit. After arriving in Spain in late 1494, Buil complained to the Spanish court of the Columbus brothers and that there was no gold. Groups of Margarit\\'s soldiers who remained in the west continued brutalizing the natives. Instead of forbidding this, Columbus participated in enslaving the indigenous people. In February 1495, he took over 1,500 Arawaks, some of whom had rebelled against the oppression of the colonists, and many of whom were subsequently released or taken by the Caribs. That month, Columbus shipped approximately 500 of these Americans to Spain to be sold as slaves; about 40% died en route, and half of the rest were sick upon arrival. In June of that year, the Spanish crown sent ships and supplies to the colony on Hispaniola, which Florentine merchant Gianotto Berardi had helped procure. In October, Berardi received almost 40,000 maravedís worth of slaves, who were alleged to be either cannibals or prisoners. The natives of Hispaniola were systematically subjugated via the encomienda system Columbus implemented. Adapted from Spain, it resembled the feudal system in Medieval Europe, as it was based on a lord offering \"protection\" to a class of people who owed labour. In addition, Spanish colonists under Columbus\\'s rule began to buy and sell natives as slaves, including children. Columbus\\'s forced labour system was described by his son Ferdinand: \"In the Cibao, where the gold mines were, every person of fourteen years of age or upward was to pay a large hawk\\'s bell of gold dust; all others were each to pay twenty-five pounds of cotton. Whenever an Indian delivered his tribute, he was to receive a brass or copper token which he must wear about his neck as proof that he had made his payment; any Indian found without such a token was to be punished.\" The monarchs, who suggested the tokens, called for a light punishment, but any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off, which was a likely death sentence. Since there was no abundance of gold on the island, the natives had no chance of meeting Columbus\\' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide. Columbus fell ill in 1495, and, as David Stannard writes, \"what little restraint he had maintained over his men disappeared as he went through a lengthy period of recuperation. The troops went wild, stealing, killing, raping, and torturing natives, trying to force them to divulge the whereabouts of the imagined treasure-houses of gold.\" According to Las Casas, 50,000 natives perished during this period (although his account has been criticized by modern historians as lacking objectivity and his population estimates are often dismissed). After recovering, Columbus organized his troops\\' efforts, forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs. Columbus\\'s men and dogs hunted down and killed natives who attempted to flee, as well as thousands who were sick and unarmed. Las Casas recounts that the hands of their captives would be cut off and left \"dangling by a shred of skin\" as a warning to their tribe; further, the soldiers placed wagers on their ability to use their sword to decapitate them or cut them in half with a single blow. The Arawaks attempted to fight back against Columbus\\'s men but lacked their armor, guns, swords, and horses. When taken prisoner, they were hanged or burned to death. According to Bartolomé de Las Casas, natives were hung in groups of thirteen \"in memory of Our Redeemer and His twelve Apostles.\" When natives on Hispaniola began fighting back against their oppressors, Columbus\\'s men captured 1,500 Arawak men, women, and children in a single raid. The strongest 500 were sent to Spain to be sold as slaves, with 40% of these dying en route. A major objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of Cape Verde. On 30 May 1498, Columbus left with six ships from Sanlúcar, Spain, for his third trip to the New World. Three of the ships headed directly for Hispaniola with much-needed supplies, while Columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the Caribbean islands he had already visited, including a hoped-for passage to continental Asia. Columbus led his fleet to the Portuguese island of Porto Santo, his wife\\'s native land. He then sailed to Madeira and spent some time there before sailing to the Canary Islands and Cape Verde. After being becalmed for several days in the doldrums of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus\\'s fleet regained its wind and, low on water, turned north in the direction of Dominica. The men sighted the land of Trinidad on 31 July, approaching from the southeast. The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered Dragon\\'s Mouth, anchoring near Soldado Rock (west of Icacos Point, Trinidad\\'s southwesternmost point) where they made contact with a group of Amerindians in canoes. On 1 August, Columbus and his men arrived at a landmass near the mouth of South America\\'s Orinoco river. Columbus recognized that it must be the continent\\'s mainland, but still believed it to be Asia. While he did not go ashore at this time, one of his men planted the Spanish flag there. On 2 August, Columbus and his men landed at Icacos Point. From 4 to 12 August, they explored the Gulf of Paria, which separates Trinidad from what is now Venezuela, near the delta of the Orinoco. On 5 August, they landed on the mainland of South America at the Paria Peninsula. Columbus then sailed to the islands of Chacachacare and Margarita (reaching the latter on 14 August), and sighted Tobago and Grenada. In poor health, Columbus returned to Hispaniola on 19 August, only to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule, claiming that Columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the New World. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. Columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience. He had an economic interest in the enslavement of the Hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them, which attracted criticism from some churchmen. An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads: \"From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold\\xa0...\" In October 1499, Columbus sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern. By this time, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court. In 1500, the Crown had him removed as governor, arrested, and transported in chains to Spain. The sovereigns replaced him with Francisco de Bobadilla, a member of the Order of Calatrava. Bobadilla had also been tasked by the Court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against Columbus. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away during the explorations of his third voyage, Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego. Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola. According to the report, Columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery. Testimony recorded in the report stated that Columbus congratulated his brother Bartolomeo on \"defending the family\" when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that Columbus was of lowly birth. The document also describes how Columbus put down native unrest and revolt: he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed, and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion. In early October 1500, Columbus and Diego presented themselves to Bobadilla, and were put in chains aboard La Gorda, Columbus\\'s own ship. They were returned to Spain, and lingered in jail for six weeks before King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long after, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to the Alhambra palace in Granada. There, the royal couple heard the brothers\\' pleas; restored their freedom and wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus\\'s fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Columbus\\'s role as governor. Henceforth Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres was to be the new governor of the West Indies. Columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the Strait of Malacca to the Indian Ocean. Accompanied by his brother Bartolomeo and his 13-year-old son Fernando, he left Cádiz on 11 May 1502, with his flagship Santa María and the vessels Gallega, Vizcaína, and Santiago de Palos. He sailed to Arzila on the Moroccan coast to rescue Portuguese soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the Moors. On 15 June, they landed at Carbet on the island of Martinique (Martinica). A hurricane was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at Santo Domingo on 29 June, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus\\'s ships sheltered at the mouth of the Rio Jaina, the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. Columbus\\'s ships survived with only minor damage, while 29 of the 30 ships in the governor\\'s fleet were lost to a storm on 1 July. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of Francisco de Bobadilla) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea. After a brief stop at Jamaica, Columbus sailed to Central America, arriving at Guanaja (Isla de Pinos) in the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras on 30 July. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as being \"long as a galley\" and filled with cargo. On 14 August, he landed on the continental mainland at Puerto Castilla, near Trujillo, Honduras. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, before arriving in Almirante Bay in Panama on 16 October. In early December 1502, Columbus and his crew endured a severe storm. In Panama, Columbus learned from the Ngobe of gold and a strait to another ocean, but was told by local leader Quibían not to go past a certain point down the river. After much exploration, in January 1503, he established a garrison at the mouth of the Belén River. On 6 April, one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked by Quibían and the other ships were damaged. Shipworms also damaged the ships in tropical waters. Columbus left for Hispaniola on 16 April heading north. On 10 May he sighted the Cayman Islands, naming them \"Las Tortugas\" after the numerous sea turtles there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel farther, on 25 June 1503 they were beached in St.\\xa0Ann\\'s Bay, Jamaica. For one year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Méndez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from Hispaniola. The governor, Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres, detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, won their favor by predicting a lunar eclipse for 29 February 1504, using Abraham Zacuto\\'s astronomical charts. Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on 29 June 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in Sanlúcar, Spain, on 7 November. Columbus had always claimed the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, but he grew increasingly religious in his later years. Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a Book of Privileges (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the Spanish Crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a Book of Prophecies (1505), in which he considered his achievements as an explorer but a fulfillment of Bible prophecy in the context of Christian eschatology. In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10 percent of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the Capitulations of Santa Fe. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the pleitos colombinos (\"Columbian lawsuits\"). During a violent storm on his first return voyage, Columbus, then 41, suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be gout. In subsequent years, he was plagued with what was thought to be influenza and other fevers, bleeding from the eyes, temporary blindness and prolonged attacks of gout. The attacks increased in duration and severity, sometimes leaving Columbus bedridden for months at a time, and culminated in his death 14 years later. Based on Columbus\\'s lifestyle and the described symptoms, modern doctors suspect that he suffered from reactive arthritis, rather than gout. Reactive arthritis is a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases (primarily chlamydia or gonorrhea). \"It seems likely that [Columbus] acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation,\" writes Dr. Frank C. Arnett, a rheumatologist and professor of internal medicine, pathology and laboratory medicine the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. On 20 May 1506, aged 54, Columbus died in Valladolid, Spain. Columbus\\'s remains were first buried at a convent in Valladolid, then moved to the monastery of La Cartuja in Seville (southern Spain) by the will of his son Diego.[citation needed] They may have been exhumed in 1513 and interred at the Cathedral of Seville. In about 1536, the remains of both Columbus and his son Diego were moved to a cathedral in Colonial Santo Domingo, in the present-day Dominican Republic. By some accounts, around 1796, when France took over the entire island of Hispaniola, Columbus\\'s remains were moved to Havana, Cuba. After Cuba became independent following the Spanish–American War in 1898, the remains were moved back to the Cathedral of Seville, Spain, where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque. In June 2003, DNA samples were taken from these remains as well as those of Columbus\\'s brother Diego and younger son Fernando. Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to match Columbus\\'s physique or age at death. DNA extraction proved difficult; only short fragments of mitochondrial DNA could be isolated. These matched corresponding DNA from Columbus\\'s brother, supporting that both individuals had shared the same mother. Such evidence, together with anthropologic and historic analyses, led the researchers to conclude that the remains belonged to Christopher Columbus. In 1877, a priest discovered a lead box at Santo Domingo inscribed: \"Discoverer of America, First Admiral\". Inscriptions found the next year read \"Last of the remains of the first admiral, Sire Christopher Columbus, discoverer.\" The box contained bones of an arm and a leg, as well as a bullet. These remains were considered legitimate by physician and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Eugene Osborne, who suggested in 1913 that they travel through the Panama Canal as a part of its opening ceremony. These remains were kept at the Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor before being moved to the Columbus Lighthouse (inaugurated in 1992). The authorities in Santo Domingo have never allowed these remains to be exhumed, so it is unconfirmed whether they are from Columbus\\'s body as well. The anniversary of Columbus\\'s 1492 landing in the Americas is usually observed on 12 October in Spain and throughout the Americas, except Canada. In Spain it is called the Fiesta Nacional de España y Día de la Hispanidad commemorating the role of Spain in world history, while a number of countries in Latin America celebrate it as Día de la Raza commemorating their common heritage. In the United States it is called Columbus Day and is observed annually on the second Monday in October. It was promoted by Italian-Americans to place themselves as part of the history of the U.S. among discrimination against Italians and Catholics. There are efforts in the U.S. to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples\\' Day.[citation needed] For the nascent United States, other European explorers such as the Venetian John Cabot made poor objects of commemoration due to their ties to Britain, which was the nation that the Americans had fought against for their independence. American nativists preferred Leif Erikson. Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. The name Columbia for \"America\" first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament. The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word \"Columbia\", or simply the name \"Columbus\", spread rapidly after the American Revolution. This was out of a desire to develop a national history and founding myth with fewer ties to Britain. Columbus\\'s name was given to the federal capital of the U.S. (District of Columbia), the capital cities of two U.S. states (Ohio and South Carolina), and the Columbia River. Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the Gran Colombia, a precursor of the modern Republic of Colombia. Numerous cities, towns, counties, streets, and plazas (called Plaza Colón or Plaza de Colón throughout Latin America and Spain) have been named after him. A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866, celebration of Columbus\\'s legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas. Monuments like the Columbus Circle in New York City were erected throughout the United States and Latin America extolling him. The Knights of Columbus is a fraternal organization for Catholic men founded in 1882. While its initial membership was mainly Irish, they took Columbus as a symbol of Catholicism in America. The World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893, commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. Over 27\\xa0million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration. The United States Postal Service participated in the celebration issuing the first U.S. commemorative stamps, a series of 16 postage issues called the Columbian Issue depicting Columbus, Queen Isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages. The issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations. Under Benjamin Harrison and his Postmaster General John Wanamaker the Columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nation\\'s first commemorative stamp to Harrison, the Congress and the U.S. Post Office. To demonstrate his confidence in the new Columbian commemorative issues Wanamaker purchased $10,000 worth of stamps with his own money. The Columbian Exposition lasted several months, and over $40\\xa0million in commemorative postage stamps had been sold. The 400th anniversary Columbian issues were very popular in the United States. A total of two billion stamps were issued for all the Columbian denominations, and 72 percent of these were the two-cent stamps, \"Landing of Columbus\", which paid the first-class rate for domestic mail at the time. In 1992, a second Columbian issue was released that was identical to the first to commemorate the 500th anniversary, except for the date in the upper right hand corner of each stamp. These issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of 1893 were produced. The United States issued the series jointly for the first time with three other countries, Italy in lire, Portugal in escudos and Spain in pesetas. In 1909, descendants of Columbus undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in Spain and move it to Boalsburg near State College, Pennsylvania, where it may now be visited by the public. At the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair that the \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" used at his chart table. Columbus\\'s voyages are considered some of the most important events in world history, kickstarting modern globalism and resulting in major demographic, commercial, economic, social, and political changes. These explorations resulted in the permanent contact between the two hemispheres. There was a massive exchange of animals, plants, fungi, diseases, technologies, mineral wealth and ideas. Exposed to old world diseases, the indigenous populations of the New world collapsed and were largely replaced by Europeans and Africans who brought with them new methods of farming, business, governance, and religious worship. Though Christopher Columbus came to be considered the discoverer of America in U.S. and European popular culture, his historical legacy is more nuanced. America had first been discovered and populated by Asians crossing Beringia (its indigenous population), and the first Europeans to reach its shores were Erik the Red in 10th-century Greenland and his son Leif Erikson in 11th-century Vinland at L\\'Anse aux Meadows. Columbus\\'s efforts brought the Americas to the attention of Europe at a time ripe for Europe to act upon. Thus, Columbus was able to initiate the enduring association between the Earth\\'s two major landmasses and their inhabitants. \"Columbus\\'s claim to fame isn\\'t that he got there first,\" explains Martin Dugard, \"it\\'s that he stayed.\" Washington Irving\\'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many Catholic theologians insisted that the Earth was flat, but this is a popular misconception which can be traced back to 17th-century Protestants campaigning against Catholicism. In fact, the spherical shape of the Earth had been known to scholars since antiquity, and was common knowledge among sailors, including Columbus. Coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the Earth, the Erdapfel, was made in 1492, just before Columbus\\'s return to Europe. As such it contains no sign of the Americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical Earth. On his third voyage, Columbus formulated a new model of the Earth shortly after observing that the North Star is not fixed. Making observations with a quadrant, he \"regularly saw the plumb line fall to the same point,\" instead of moving along as his ship moved. He divined that he had discovered the entrance to Heaven, from which Earth\\'s waters extend, the planet forming a pear-shape with the insurmountable \"stalk\" portion of the pear pointing towards Heaven. In fact, the Earth ever so slightly is pear-shaped, with the \"stalk\" pointing North. Historians have traditionally argued that Columbus remained convinced until his death that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia as he originally intended, but writer Kirkpatrick Sale argues that a document in the Book of Privileges indicates Columbus knew he found a new continent. Furthermore, his journals from the third voyage call the \"land of Paria\" a \"hitherto unknown\" continent. On the other hand, his other writings continued to claim that he had reached Asia, such as a 1502 letter to Pope Alexander VI where he asserted that Cuba was the east coast of Asia. He also rationalized that the new continent of South America was the \"Earthly Paradise\" that was located \"at the end of the Orient\". The term \"pre-Columbian\" is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and his European successors. Columbus is both criticized for his alleged brutality and initiating the depopulation of the indigenous Americans, whether by disease or intentional genocide. Some defend his alleged actions or say the worst of them are not based in fact. As a result of both the protests and riots that followed the killing of George Floyd in 2020, many public monuments of Christopher Columbus began to be removed. Historians have criticized Columbus for initiating colonization and for abuse of natives. On St. Croix, Columbus let his friend Michele da Cuneo keep an indigenous woman he captured, then, by his own account, brutally raped her. Tony Horwitz notes that this is the first recorded instance of sexuality between a European and Native American. The punishment for an indigenous person failing to fill their hawk\\'s bell of gold dust every three months was cutting off the hands of those without tokens, letting them bleed to death. Thousands of natives are thought to have committed suicide by poison to escape their persecution. The neutrality and accuracy of Bobadilla\\'s 48-page report accusing Columbus and his brothers of using torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola have been disputed by historians, given the anti-Italian sentiment of the Spaniards and Bobadilla\\'s desire to take over Columbus\\' position. Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian who has seen the report, states that \"Columbus\\'s government was characterised by a form of tyranny. Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.\" Some accounts of the alleged brutality of Columbus and his brothers may be part of the Black Legend, an alleged intentional defamation of Spain, while others challenge the genocide narrative. Some historians have argued that, while brutal, Columbus was simply a product of his time, and being a figure of the 15th century, should not be judged by the morality of the 20th century. Others openly defend colonization. Spanish ambassador María Jesús Figa López-Palop claims, \"Normally we melded with the cultures in America, we stayed there, we spread our language and culture and religion.\" Horwitz asserts that paternalistic attitudes were often characteristic of the colonists themselves. Modern estimates for the pre-Columbian population of Hispaniola vary from ten thousand to more than a million. Some estimate that a third or more of the natives in Haiti were dead within the first two years of Columbus\\'s governorship, many from lethal forced labour in the mines, in which a third of workers died every six months. Within three decades, the surviving Arawak population numbered only in the hundreds; \"virtually every member of the gentle race ... had been wiped out.\" Indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1,500 colonists who accompanied Columbus\\'s second expedition in 1493. Charles C. Mann writes that \"It was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in Eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades.\" According to the historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, by 1548, 56 years after Columbus landed, and 42 years after he died, fewer than 500 Taíno were living on the island. The indigenous population was reduced by some 90% overall in the century following Columbus\\'s arrival. Disease, warfare and harsh enslavement contributed to the depopulation. Within indigenous circles, Columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide. Samuel Eliot Morison, a Harvard historian and author of a multivolume biography on Columbus, writes, \"The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide.\" According to Noble David Cook, \"There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact\". He instead estimates that the death toll was caused by smallpox, the first pandemic of European endemic diseases, which struck Hispaniola after the arrival of Hernán Cortés in 1519. According to some estimates, smallpox had an 80–90% fatality rate in Native American populations. The natives had no acquired immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities. There is also evidence that they had poor diets and were overworked. Historian Andrés Reséndez of University of California, Davis, says the available evidence suggests \"slavery has emerged as major killer\" of the indigenous populations of the Caribbean between 1492 and 1550 more so than diseases such as smallpox, influenza and malaria. He says that indigenous populations did not experience a rebound like European populations did following the Black Death because unlike the latter, the former were subjected to deadly forced labour in gold and silver mines on a massive scale. The diseases that devastated the Native Americans came in multiple waves at different times, sometimes as much as centuries apart, which would mean that survivors of one disease may have been killed by others, preventing the population from recovering. Biographers and historians have a wide range of opinions over Columbus\\'s expertise and experience navigating and captaining ships. One scholar lists some European works ranging from the 1890s to 1980s that support Columbus\\'s experience and skill as among the best in Genoa, while listing some American works over a similar timeframe that portray the explorer as an untrained entrepreneur, having only minor crew or passenger experience prior to his noted journeys. Contemporary descriptions of Columbus, including those by his son Ferdinand and Las Casas, describe him as taller than average, with light skin (which was often sunburnt), blue or hazel eyes, high cheekbones and freckled face, an aquiline nose, and blond to reddish hair and beard (until about the age of 30, when it began to whiten). Although an abundance of artwork depicts Christopher Columbus, no authentic contemporary portrait is known. The most iconic image of Columbus is a portrait by Sebastiano del Piombo, which has been reproduced in many textbooks. It agrees with descriptions of Columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair, but the painting dates from 1519 and cannot, therefore, have been painted from life. Furthermore, the inscription identifying the subject as Columbus was probably added later, and the face shown differs from other images. Sometime between 1531 and 1536, Alejo Fernández painted an altarpiece, The Virgin of the Navigators, that includes a depiction of Columbus. The painting was commissioned for a chapel in Seville\\'s Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) and remains there, as the earliest known painting about the voyages of Columbus. At the World\\'s Columbian Exposition in 1893, 71 alleged portraits of Columbus were displayed; most did not match contemporary descriptions.

The two main early biographies of Columbus have been taken as literal truth by hundreds of writers, in large part because they were written by individuals closely connected to Columbus or his writings.\\xa0... Both biographies have serious shortcomings as evidence.\" (Phillips, Jr & Phillips 1992, p.\\xa09) About 10,600 nautical miles Ferdinand later claimed credit for being \"the principal cause why those islands were discovered.\" Felipe Fernández-Armesto points out that Columbus briefly described South America as an unknown continent after seeing the mainland for the first time. Vespucci seems to have modeled his naming of the \"new world\" after Columbus\\'s description of this discovery. Further, mapmaker Martin Waldseemüller eventually retracted his naming of the continent after Vespucci, seemingly after it came to light that a claim that Vespucci visited the mainland before Columbus had been falsified. In his new map, Waldseemüller labelled the continent as Terra Incognita (\\'unknown land\\'), noting that it had been discovered by Columbus. This map is based on the premise that Columbus first landed at Plana Cays. The island considered by Samuel Eliot Morison to be the most likely location of first contact is the easternmost land touching the top edge of this image. Shen Kuo discovered 400 years earlier, in Asia, the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole, with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and \"the improved meridian determined by Shen\\'s [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the polestar and true north\". Two others thought that they saw such a light, one independently from Columbus. The strong winds and the fact that they were some 56 kilometres (35\\xa0mi) from land indicate that this was unlikely from a native inhabitant fishing. According to Samuel Eliot Morison, San Salvador Island, renamed from Watling\\'s Island in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus\\'s San Salvador, is the only island fitting the position indicated by Columbus\\'s journal. Other candidates are the Grand Turk, Cat Island, Rum Cay, Samana Cay, or Mayaguana. Torres spoke Hebrew and some Arabic; the latter was then believed to be the mother tongue of all languages. He wrote, While I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me. When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked—as was their custom. I was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire. She was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that I wished I had never begun. But—to cut a long story short—I then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears. Eventually we came to such terms, I assure you, that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores. Amerigo Vespucci was an associate of Berardi. Berardi became unwell in December, and recorded that Columbus still owed him 180,000 maravedís for his contributions. He also left his daughter to the admiral\\'s care, calling him \"his lordship\", although it is unknown what became of her. The hawk\\'s bells were to be filled with gold every three months. The tribute system had all but collapsed by 1497. King John reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because \"canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise.\" Bobadilla\\'s 48-page report, derived from the testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers—had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in Valladolid. It contained an account of Columbus\\'s seven-year reign as the first governor of the Indies. Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian, states: \"Even those who loved him [Columbus] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.\" According to Professor Miguel Patella of the University of Granada, who was present the last time Columbus\\'s crypt was opened, these include part of a jaw and an arm, as well as a couple of leg bones and vertebrae. This same year, dust collected from these remains was placed in a locket, which was placed inside the stern of a silver model caravel. Two tiny portions of dust from the same source were placed in separate vials. Osborne cited the bullet as evidence the remains belonged to Columbus, but its significance is unclear. These remains are displayed in their crypt (behind a sheet of glass) once a year on Columbus Day. Lester, Paul M. (January 1993). \"Looks are deceiving: The portraits of Christopher Columbus\".

While most of the other epidemics in history however were confined to a single pathogen and typically lasted for less than a decade, the Americas differed in that multiple pathogens caused multiple waves of virgin soil epidemics over more than a century. Those who survived influenza, may later have succumbed to smallpox, while those who survived both, may then have caught a later wave of measles. Hence, there were documented disease outbreaks in the Americas that killed 30% of the remaining indigenous population over 50 years after initial contact, i.e. between 1568 CE and 1605 CE Peck, Douglas T.

His expeditions, sponsored by the [[Catholic Monarchs of Spain]], were the first European contact with the [[Caribbean]], [[Central America]], and [[South America]].\\n\\nScholars generally agree that Columbus was born in the [[Republic of Genoa]] and spoke a dialect of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] as his first language. He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now [[Ghana]]. He married Portuguese noblewoman [[Filipa Moniz Perestrelo]] and was based in [[Lisbon]] for several years, but later took a Castilian mistress; he had one son with each woman. Though largely self-educated, Columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and history. He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the [[East Indies]], hoping to profit from the lucrative [[spice trade]]. Following Columbus\\'s persistent lobbying to multiple kingdoms, Catholic monarchs [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand II]] agreed to sponsor a journey west. Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships, and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October (ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the [[pre-Columbian era]]). His landing place was an island in [[the Bahamas]], known by its native inhabitants as [[Guanahani]]. Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]], establishing [[La Navidad|a colony]] in what is now [[Haiti]]. This was the first European settlement in the Americas since the [[Norse colonization of North America|Norse colonies]] begun some 500 years earlier. Columbus returned to Castile in early 1493, bringing a number of captured natives with him. [[Columbus\\'s letter on the first voyage|Word of his voyages]] soon spread throughout Europe.\\n\\nColumbus made three further voyages to the New World, exploring the [[Lesser Antilles]] in 1493, [[Trinidad]] and the northern coast of South America in 1498, and the eastern coast of Central America in 1502. Many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use. He continued to seek a passage to the East Indies, and the extent to which he was aware that the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain. He never clearly renounced his belief that he had reached the Far East and gave the name \\'\\'indios\\'\\' (\"Indians\") to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] he encountered. As a colonial governor, Columbus was accused by his contemporaries of significant brutality and was soon removed from the post. Columbus\\'s strained relationship with the [[Crown of Castile]] and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500, and later to [[Pleitos colombinos|protracted litigation]] over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown. Columbus\\'s expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, helping create the modern [[Western world]]. The transfers between the Old World and New World that followed his first voyage are known as the [[Columbian exchange]].\\n\\nColumbus was widely venerated in the centuries after his death, but public perception has fractured in recent decades as scholars give greater attention to the harm committed under his governance, particularly the near-extermination of Hispaniola\\'s indigenous [[Taíno]] population from mistreatment and European diseases, as well as their [[enslavement]]. Proponents of the [[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]] theory of history claim that Columbus has been unfairly maligned as part of a wider [[anti-Catholic sentiment]]. Many landmarks and institutions in the [[Western Hemisphere]] bear [[Columbia (personification)|his name]], including the country of [[Colombia]] and the [[District of Columbia]].\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n<!--THIS SECTION IS LARGELY BASED ON BRITANNICA AND MORISON\\'s \\'\\'Christopher Columbus\\'\\'-->\\n{{details|topic=Columbus\\'s birthplace and family background|Origin theories of Christopher Columbus}}\\n[[File:Christopher Columbus at the gates of the monastery of Santa Maria de la Rabida with his son Diego.jpg|thumb|upright|\\'\\'Christopher Columbus at the gates of the [[La Rábida Friary|monastery of Santa María de la Rábida]] with his son Diego\\'\\', by [[Benet Mercadé]]]]\\n\\nThe name \\'\\'Christopher Columbus\\'\\' is the [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Latin]] \\'\\'\\'Christophorus Columbus\\'\\'\\'.

Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The Catholic Monarchs, however, having completed [[Reconquista|an expensive war]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus\\'s project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), \\'\\'Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.\\'\\' p. 341</ref>\\n\\n=== Nautical considerations ===\\nThough Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the [[trade winds]], which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called [[Close hauled#Close hauled|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.\\nInstead, Columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he was able to catch the \"[[westerlies]]\" that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe. There, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\\n\\nIt is unclear whether Columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others. The corresponding technique for efficient travel in the Atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the \\'\\'[[Volta do mar]]\\'\\' (\"turn of the sea\"). Columbus\\'s knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage. By sailing directly due west from the Canary Islands during [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]], skirting the so-called [[horse latitudes]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a [[tropical cyclone]], both of which, by chance, he avoided.{{sfn|Morison|1991|p=}}\\n\\n=== Quest for financial support for a voyage ===\\n[[File:Columbus offers his services to the King of Portugal - Daniel Nicholas Chodowiecki (cropped).png|thumb|upright=0.75|\\'\\'Columbus offers his services to the King of Portugal\\'\\'; [[Daniel Chodowiecki|Chodowiecki]], 17th&nbsp;century]]\\n\\nBy about 1484, Columbus proposed his planned voyage to King [[John II of Portugal]].{{Sfn|Dyson|1991|pp=67, 69}} The king submitted Columbus\\'s proposal to his experts, who rejected it on the correct belief that Columbus\\'s estimate for a voyage of 2,400 nautical miles was only a quarter of what it should have been.{{sfn|Morison|1991|pp=68–70}} Columbus traveled from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] to both Genoa and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, resulting in John II again inviting him for an audience.

They pronounced the idea impractical and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the [[Carthusian]] monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a \\'\\'[[Book of Privileges]]\\'\\' (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the Spanish Crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a \\'\\'Book of Prophecies\\'\\' (1505), in which he considered his achievements as an explorer but a fulfillment of Bible prophecy in the context of Christian eschatology.<ref name=britannica />{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=2}}\\n\\nIn his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10 percent of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the \\'\\'[[pleitos colombinos]]\\'\\' (\"Columbian lawsuits\").\\n\\nDuring a violent storm on his first return voyage, Columbus, then 41, suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be [[gout]]. In subsequent years, he was plagued with what was thought to be [[influenza]] and other fevers, bleeding from the eyes, temporary blindness and prolonged attacks of gout.

       "     'opening_text': 'Christopher Columbus (/kəˈlʌmbəs/; between 25 August and 31 October 1451\\xa0– 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer and navigator who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, opening the way for European exploration and colonization of the Americas. His expeditions, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, were the first European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Scholars generally agree that Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language. He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years, but later took a Castilian mistress; he had one son with each woman. Though largely self-educated, Columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and history. He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade. Following Columbus\\'s persistent lobbying to multiple kingdoms, Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west. Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships, and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October (ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre-Columbian era). His landing place was an island in the Bahamas, known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani. Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola, establishing a colony in what is now Haiti. This was the first European settlement in the Americas since the Norse colonies begun some 500 years earlier. Columbus returned to Castile in early 1493, bringing a number of captured natives with him. Word of his voyages soon spread throughout Europe. Columbus made three further voyages to the New World, exploring the Lesser Antilles in 1493, Trinidad and the northern coast of South America in 1498, and the eastern coast of Central America in 1502. Many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use. He continued to seek a passage to the East Indies, and the extent to which he was aware that the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain. He never clearly renounced his belief that he had reached the Far East and gave the name indios (\"Indians\") to the indigenous peoples he encountered. As a colonial governor, Columbus was accused by his contemporaries of significant brutality and was soon removed from the post. Columbus\\'s strained relationship with the Crown of Castile and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500, and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown. Columbus\\'s expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, helping create the modern Western world. The transfers between the Old World and New World that followed his first voyage are known as the Columbian exchange. Columbus was widely venerated in the centuries after his death, but public perception has fractured in recent decades as scholars give greater attention to the harm committed under his governance, particularly the near-extermination of Hispaniola\\'s indigenous Taíno population from mistreatment and European diseases, as well as their enslavement. Proponents of the Black Legend theory of history claim that Columbus has been unfairly maligned as part of a wider anti-Catholic sentiment.

       "    'extract': '<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\\n</p>\\n\\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\\n</p>\\n<p><b>Christopher Columbus</b> (<span></span>; between 25 August and 31 October 1451\\xa0– 20 May 1506) was an Italian  explorer and navigator who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, opening the way for European exploration and colonization of the Americas. His expeditions, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, were the first European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.\\n</p><p>Scholars generally agree that Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language. He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years, but later took a Castilian mistress; he had one son with each woman. Though largely self-educated, Columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and history. He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade. Following Columbus\\'s persistent lobbying to multiple kingdoms, Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west. Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships, and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October (ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre-Columbian era). His landing place was an island in the Bahamas, known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani. Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola, establishing a colony in what is now Haiti. This was the first European settlement in the Americas since the Norse colonies begun some 500 years earlier. Columbus returned to Castile in early 1493, bringing a number of captured natives with him. Word of his voyages soon spread throughout Europe.\\n</p><p>Columbus made three further voyages to the New World, exploring the Lesser Antilles in 1493, Trinidad and the northern coast of South America in 1498, and the eastern coast of Central America in 1502. Many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use. He continued to seek a passage to the East Indies, and the extent to which he was aware that the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain. He never clearly renounced his belief that he had reached the Far East and gave the name <i>indios</i> (\"Indians\") to the indigenous peoples he encountered. As a colonial governor, Columbus was accused by his contemporaries of significant brutality and was soon removed from the post. Columbus\\'s strained relationship with the Crown of Castile and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500, and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown. Columbus\\'s expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, helping create the modern Western world. The transfers between the Old World and New World that followed his first voyage are known as the Columbian exchange.\\n</p><p>Columbus was widely venerated in the centuries after his death, but public perception has fractured in recent decades as scholars give greater attention to the harm committed under his governance, particularly the near-extermination of Hispaniola\\'s indigenous Taíno population from mistreatment and European diseases, as well as their enslavement. Proponents of the Black Legend theory of history claim that Columbus has been unfairly maligned as part of a wider anti-Catholic sentiment. Many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of Colombia and the District of Columbia.\\n</p>',\n",

       "     'text': 'A total lunar eclipse occurred on 1 March 1504, visible at sunset for the Americas, and later over night over Europe and Africa, and near sunrise over Asia. Christopher Columbus, in an effort to induce the natives of Jamaica to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully intimidated the natives by correctly predicting a total lunar eclipse for 1 March 1504 (visible on the evening of 29 February in the Americas). Some have claimed that Columbus used the Ephemeris of the German astronomer Regiomontanus, but Columbus himself attributed the prediction to the Almanach by Abraham Zacuto. The eclipse was visible after sunset on 29 February from most of North America, all of South America, as well as across Europe, Africa, and western Asia on the morning of 1 March. On 30 June 1503, Christopher Columbus beached his two last caravels and was stranded in Jamaica. The indigenous people of the island welcomed Columbus and his crew and fed them, but after six months, the natives halted the food supply. Columbus had on board an almanac authored by Abraham Zacuto of astronomical tables covering the years 1475–1506. Upon consulting the book, he noticed the date and the time of an upcoming lunar eclipse. He was able to use this information to his advantage. He requested a meeting for that day with the Cacique, the leader, and told him that God was angry with the local people\\'s treatment of Columbus and his men[citation needed]. Columbus said God would provide a clear sign of displeasure by making the rising full Moon appear \"inflamed with wrath\"[citation needed]. The lunar eclipse and the red Moon appeared on schedule, and the indigenous people were impressed and frightened. The son of Columbus, Ferdinand, wrote that the people: with great howling and lamentation they came running from every direction to the ships, laden with provisions, praying the Admiral to intercede by all means with God on their behalf; that he might not visit his wrath upon them ... Columbus went into his cabin to pray and timed the eclipse with his hourglass, and shortly before the totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened indigenous people that they were going to be forgiven. When the Moon started to reappear from the shadow of the Earth, he told them that God had pardoned them. Columbus was maybe the first to put into practice an idea proposed by Hipparchus, to use a lunar eclipse to determine one\\'s geographical longitude. A lunar eclipse is visible across half the globe, and everyone sees it begin and end at the same moment. But the times when measured in the local solar time will differ, because everyone is in a different time zone. The local time is determined by observing the rise, culmination, or setting of the Sun. Now an almanac will predict an eclipse for some place at a certain geographical longitude at a specific local time there. The same event observed elsewhere will occur at a different clocktime. The difference in time is proportional to the difference in geographical longitude, by 15 degrees per hour. Columbus had no accurate means to determine how far he had travelled West on the globe. He observed the lunar eclipses of 15 September 1494 near Hispaniola (Dominican Republic), and that of 29 February 1504 from Jamaica. In the latter case he reported in his journal that Jamaica was 7 hours and 15 minutes from Cadiz in Spain - well on his way to China. However his site at Jamaica is actually at a longitude 4 hours 44 minutes from Cadiz. How Columbus could make such a large error of 2\\u200b1⁄2 hours remains puzzling, but D.W. Olson proposed a reconstruction. Columbus presumably used the Calendarium from Regiomontanus. This almanac gives the time of mid-eclipse at Nuremberg, but if Columbus erroneously interpreted the listed time as that of the beginning of the partial eclipse, then his 2\\u200b1⁄2h error could be explained. One can imagine that such false evidence confirmed Columbus in his belief he had reached China, overlooking the fact that he discovered an entire unknown continent. H. Rider Haggard used an altered version of the real story of the rescue of Columbus in his novel King Solomon\\'s Mines (first published 1885), where hero Allan Quatermain and his companions recruit supporters for their cause from the local tribe by predicting a lunar eclipse. (In early editions, this was a solar eclipse; Haggard changed it after realising that his description of a solar eclipse was not realistic) In Mark Twain\\'s 1889 novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court, the protagonist, Hank Morgan, a time-travelling 19th-century resident of Hartford, Connecticut, escapes being burned at the stake by predicting a solar eclipse in early medieval England during the time of the legendary King Arthur. Bolesław Prus\\' historical novel, Pharaoh, written in 1894–95, also uses this trope. A similar plot also features in The Adventures of Tintin comic, Prisoners of the Sun, first published between 1946 and 1948. The Guatemalan writer Augusto Monterroso used a similar plot in his short novel El eclipse, published in 1959 in Obras completas (y otros cuentos), but with an opposite ending, sarcastic and anticolonialist.

A lunar eclipse is visible across half the globe, and everyone sees it begin and end at the same moment.  But the times when measured in the local solar time will differ, because everyone is in a different time zone.  The local time is determined by observing the rise, culmination, or setting of the Sun.  Now an almanac will predict an eclipse for some place at a certain geographical longitude at a specific local time there.  The same event observed elsewhere will occur at a different clocktime.  The difference in time is proportional to the difference in geographical longitude, by 15 degrees per hour.\\n\\nColumbus had no accurate means to determine how far he had travelled West on the globe.  He observed the lunar eclipses of 15 September 1494 near [[Hispaniola]] ([[Dominican Republic]]), and that of 29 February 1504 from [[Jamaica]].  In the latter case he reported in his journal that Jamaica was 7 hours and 15 minutes from [[Cadiz]] in Spain - well on his way to China.  However his site at Jamaica is actually at a longitude 4 hours 44 minutes from Cadiz.    How Columbus could make such a large error of 2{{frac|1|2}} hours remains puzzling, but D.W. Olson proposed a reconstruction.<ref>D.W. Olson, \"Columbus and an eclipse of the Moon\", Sky & Telescope, October 1992, pp. 437..440</ref>\\n\\nColumbus presumably used the Calendarium from [[Regiomontanus]].  This almanac gives the time of mid-eclipse at [[Nuremberg]], but if Columbus erroneously interpreted the listed time as that of the beginning of the partial eclipse, then his 2{{frac|1|2}}h error could be explained.  One can imagine that such false evidence confirmed Columbus in his belief he had reached China, overlooking the fact that he discovered an entire unknown continent.\\n\\n=== Fictional variations ===\\n[[H. Rider Haggard]] used an altered version of the real story of the rescue of Columbus in his novel \\'\\'[[King Solomon\\'s Mines]]\\'\\' (first published 1885), where hero [[Allan Quatermain]] and his companions recruit supporters for their cause from the local tribe by predicting a [[lunar eclipse]]. (In early editions, this was a solar eclipse; Haggard changed it after realising that his description of a solar eclipse was not realistic)\\n\\nIn [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain\\'s]] 1889 novel, \\'\\'[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court]]\\'\\', the protagonist, Hank Morgan, a [[Time travel|time-travelling]] 19th-century resident of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], escapes being burned at the stake by predicting a [[solar eclipse]] in [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval England]] during the time of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. [[Bolesław Prus]]\\' historical novel, \\'\\'[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]\\'\\', written in 1894–95, also uses this trope.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Prus\\' \\'\\'Pharaoh\\'\\' and the Solar Eclipse\", \\'\\'[[The Polish Review]]\\'\\', 1997, no. 4, pp. 471-78.</ref>\\n\\nA similar plot also features in \\'\\'[[The Adventures of Tintin]]\\'\\' comic, \\'\\'[[Prisoners of the Sun]]\\'\\', first published between 1946 and 1948.\\n\\nThe Guatemalan writer [[Augusto Monterroso]] used a similar plot in his short novel \\'\\'El eclipse\\'\\', published in 1959 in \\'\\'Obras completas (y otros cuentos)\\'\\', but with an opposite ending, sarcastic and anticolonialist.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[List of 16th-century lunar eclipses]]\\n* [[Historically significant lunar eclipses]]\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==References==\\n* [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE1501-1600.html Lunar eclipses 1501-1600]\\n* [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEsaros/LEsaros105.html Lunar saros 105]\\n* [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEhistory/LEplot/LE1504Mar01T.pdf NASA graphic]\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/7809/title/The_Eclipse_That_Saved_Columbus Science News: The Eclipse That Saved Columbus, By Ivars Peterson ]\\n* [http://www.space.com/spacewatch/080208-ns-lunar-eclipse-columbus.html Space.com: How a Lunar Eclipse Saved Columbus, By Joe Rao, 08 February 2008]\\n* [http://starryskies.com/The_sky/events/lunar-2003/columbus.eclipse.html starryskies.com: Christopher Columbus and the Lunar Eclipse]\\n* [http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/3245/?letter=C&spage=3 www.wordinfo.info Christopher Columbus Survived by Using a Lunar Eclipse Trick]\\n\\n{{Lunar eclipses}}\\n\\n{{Authority control}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lunar eclipse 1504-03}}\\n[[Category:2nd-millennium lunar eclipses|1504-03]]\\n[[Category:1504 in science]]\\n[[Category:History of the Americas]]\\n[[Category:Christopher Columbus]]',\n",

       "     'text': 'Queen Anne\\'s War (1702–1713) was the second in a series of French and Indian Wars fought in England\\'s Thirteen American Colonies; it took place during the reign of Anne, Queen of Great Britain. In Europe, it is generally viewed as the American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession; in the Americas, it is more commonly viewed as a standalone conflict. It is also known as the Third Indian War or as the Second Intercolonial War in France. The war broke out in 1701 and was primarily a conflict between French, Spanish and English colonists for control of the American continent while the War of the Spanish Succession was being fought in Europe, with each side allied to various Native American tribes. It was fought on four fronts: In the south, Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina attacked one another, and English colonists engaged French colonists based at Mobile, Alabama, with allied Indians on both sides. The southern war did not result in significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida and parts of southern Georgia, and destroying the network of Spanish missions in Florida. In New England, English colonists fought against French colonists and Indian forces in Acadia and Canada. Quebec City was repeatedly targeted by British colonial expeditions, and the Acadian capital Port Royal was captured in 1710. The French colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart British expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in what is now southern Maine. They executed raids in the Province of Massachusetts Bay (including Maine), most famously the Raid on Deerfield in 1704. In Newfoundland, English colonists based at St. John\\'s disputed control of the island with the French colonists of Plaisance. Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids on settlements. The French colonists successfully captured St. John\\'s in 1709, but the British colonists quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it. French privateers based in Acadia and Placentia captured many ships from New England\\'s fishing and shipping industries. Privateers took 102 prizes into Placentia, second only to Martinique in France\\'s American colonies. The naval conflict ended with the capture of Acadia (Nova Scotia). The Treaty of Utrecht ended the war in 1713, following a preliminary peace in 1712. France ceded the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland to Britain while retaining Cape Breton Island and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some terms were ambiguous in the treaty, and the concerns of various Indian tribes were not included, thereby setting the stage for future conflicts. When war broke out in Europe in 1701 following the death of King Charles II concerning who should succeed him to the Spanish throne, it was initially restricted to a few powers in Europe, but it widened in May 1702 when England declared war on Spain and France. Both the British and French wanted to keep their American colonies neutral, but they did not reach an agreement. But the American colonists had their own tensions which had been growing along the borders separating the French and English colonies, especially concerning boundaries and governing authority in the northern and southwestern frontiers of the English colonies, which stretched from the Province of Carolina in the south to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on Newfoundland and at Hudson Bay. The total population of the English colonies was about 250,000, with Virginia and New England dominating. The residents were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching as far as the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists knew little of the interior of the continent to the west of the Appalachians and south of the Great Lakes. This area was dominated by Indian tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated it. Spanish missionaries in La Florida had established a network of missions to convert the Indians to Roman Catholicism. The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indian population to whom they ministered has been estimated at 20,000. French explorers had located the mouth of the Mississippi River, and they established a small colonial presence at Fort Maurepas near Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1699. From there, they began to build trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the Choctaw, a large tribe whose enemies included the British-allied Chickasaw. All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of infectious diseases such as smallpox by early explorers and traders. The arrival of French colonists in the south threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides of the recently ended Nine Years\\' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic colonists of New Spain and the Protestant colonists along the coast. To the north, the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes. Newfoundland was the site of a British colony at St. John\\'s and a French colony at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks, which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts. The borders and boundaries remained uncertain between Acadia and New England despite battles along the border throughout King William\\'s War. New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay near Castine, Maine, which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William\\'s War. The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by Indians, primarily Abenaki and Iroquois, and the Hudson River–Lake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements. The Hudson Bay territories (also known as Prince Rupert\\'s Land) were not significantly fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson\\'s Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied for their return in the negotiations that ended this war. Military technology used in America was not as developed as in Europe. Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications at the start of the war, such as St. Augustine, Florida, Boston, Quebec City, and St. John\\'s, Newfoundland and Labrador, although Port Royal\\'s fortifications were completed early in the war. Some villages and settlements were protected by wooden palisades, but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with gun ports through which defenders could fire, and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below. Europeans and colonists were typically armed with smooth-bore muskets that had a maximum range of about 100 yards (91\\xa0m) but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance. Some colonists also carried pikes, while Indian warriors either carried arms supplied by the colonists or were armed with weapons such as primitive tomahawks and bows. A small number of colonists had training in the operation of cannon and other types of artillery which were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses. English colonists were generally organized into militia companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland. The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the troupes de la marine. This force consisted of some experienced officers and was manned by recruits sent over from France numbering between 500 and 1,200. They were spread throughout the territories of New France, with concentrations in the major population centers. Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indians in their territory and not to provide them with weapons. Florida held an estimated 8,000 Indians before the war, but this was reduced to 200 after English colonist raids made early in the war. Prominent French and English colonists understood at the turn of the 18th century that control of the Mississippi River would have a significant role in future development and trade, and each developed visionary plans to thwart the other\\'s activities. French Canadian explorer Pierre Le Moyne d\\'Iberville had developed a \"Project sur la Caroline\" in the aftermath of the previous war which called for establishing relationships with Indians in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English colonists off the continent, or at least limit them to coastal areas. In pursuit of this grand strategy, he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi (which had first been found by La Salle in 1670) and established Fort Maurepas in 1699. From this base and Fort Louis de la Mobile (founded in 1702), he began to establish relationships with the local Choctaw, Chickasaw, Natchez, and other tribes. English colonial traders and explorers from Carolina had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended all the way to the Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests. Iberville had approached the Spanish in January 1702 before the war broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola, Florida in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense at the head of the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force with some 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured. Carolina\\'s Governor Moore received notification concerning the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida. 500 English colonial soldiers and militia and 300 Indians captured and burned the town of St. Augustine, Florida in the Siege of St. Augustine (1702). The English were unable to take the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana. The Apalachee and Timucua of Spanish Florida were virtually wiped out in a raiding expedition by Moore that became known as the Apalachee massacre of 1704. Many of the survivors of these raids were relocated to the Savannah River where they were confined to reservations. Raids continued in the following years consisting of large Indian forces, sometimes including a small number of white men; this included major expeditions directed at Pensacola in 1707 and Mobile in 1709. The Muscogee (Creek), Yamasee, and Chickasaw were armed and led by English colonists, and they dominated these conflicts at the expense of the Choctaw, Timucua, and Apalachee. Throughout the war, New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy thwarted New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. In 1703, Michel Leneuf de la Vallière de Beaubassin commanded a few French Canadians and 500 Indians of the Wabanaki Confederacy, and they led attacks against New England settlements from Wells to Falmouth (Portland, Maine) in the Northeast Coast Campaign. They killed or captured more than 300 settlers. In February 1704, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville led 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga Indians and 50 French Canadians in a raid on Deerfield in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and destroyed the settlement, killing and capturing many colonists. More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, where most of the children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man. There was an active slave trade of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity. New England colonists were unable to effectively combat these raids, so they retaliated by launching an expedition against Acadia led by the famous American Indian fighter Benjamin Church. The expedition raided Grand Pré, Chignecto, and other settlements. French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia\\'s capital of Port Royal, but Church\\'s account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack. Father Sébastien Rale was widely suspected of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. In the winter of 1705, Massachusetts dispatched 275 militiamen under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church. French and Wabanaki Confederacy continued making raids in northern Massachusetts in 1705, against which the New England colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while leaders from New France and New England negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted until the end of the war, sometimes with French participation. In May 1707, Governor Dudley organized an expedition to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported that two-thirds of the fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out. In October 1710, 3,600 British and colonial forces led by Francis Nicholson finally captured Port Royal after a siege of one week. This ended official French control of the peninsular portion of Acadia (present-day mainland Nova Scotia), although resistance continued until the end of the war. Resistance by the Wabanaki Confederation continued in the 1711 Battle of Bloody Creek and raids along the Maine frontier. The remainder of Acadia (present-day eastern Maine and New Brunswick) remained disputed territory between New England and New France. The French in New France\\'s heartland of Canada opposed attacking the Province of New York. They were reluctant to arouse the Iroquois, whom they feared more than they did the British colonists and with whom they had made the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. New York merchants were opposed to attacking New France because it would interrupt the lucrative Indian fur trade, much of which came through New France. The Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict, despite Peter Schuyler\\'s efforts to interest them in the war. (Schuyler was Albany\\'s commissioner of Indians.) Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch organized an ambitious assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical support from the queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached the southern end of Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson\\'s successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711. The plan for 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks, but its execution was a disaster. A fleet of 15 ships of the line and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June, doubling the town\\'s population and greatly straining the colony\\'s ability to provide necessary provisions. The expedition sailed for Quebec at the end of July, but a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog. More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called off the expedition. In the meantime, Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland but had only reached Lake George when word reached him of Walker\\'s disaster, and he also turned back. In this expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English colonists, but they simultaneously sent warnings to the French about the expedition, effectively playing both sides of the conflict. Newfoundland\\'s coast was dotted with small French and English communities, with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe. Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John\\'s on Conception Bay. During King William\\'s War, d\\'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696–97, and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance. During the winter of 1705, Plaisance\\'s French governor Daniel d\\'Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi\\'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John\\'s. The French and their Indian allies continued to harass the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at £188,000. The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island\\'s northern coasts. In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi\\'kmaq volunteers captured St. John\\'s and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John\\'s was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709. (The same French expedition also tried to take Ferryland, but it successfully resisted.) English fleet commanders contemplated attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 but did not make them, the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence. In 1712, Britain and France declared an armistice, and a final peace agreement was signed the following year. Under terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained Acadia (which they renamed Nova Scotia), sovereignty over Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay region, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. France recognized British suzerainty over the Iroquois and agreed that commerce with American Indians farther inland would be open to all nations. It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including Cape Breton Island, and retained fishing rights in the area, including rights to dry fish on the northern shore of Newfoundland. By the later years of the war, many Abenakis had tired of the conflict despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indian interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders. Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River and the establishment of government-run trading posts in their territory. The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713 by eight representatives of some of the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory. Over the next year, other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty, but no Mi\\'kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726. The loss of Newfoundland and Acadia restricted the French presence on the Atlantic to Cape Breton Island. French were resettled there from Newfoundland, creating the colony of Île-Royale, and France constructed the Fortress of Louisbourg in the following years. This presence plus the rights to use the Newfoundland shore resulted in continued friction between French and British fishing interests, which was not fully resolved until late in the 18th century. The economic effects of the war were severe in Newfoundland, with the fishing fleets significantly reduced. The British fishing fleet began to recover immediately after the peace was finalized, and they attempted to prevent Spanish ships from fishing in Newfoundland waters, as they previously had. However, many Spanish ships were simply reflagged with English straw owners to evade British controls. The British capture of Acadia had long-term consequences for the Acadians and Mi\\'kmaq living there. Britain\\'s hold on Nova Scotia was initially quite tenuous, a situation on which French and Mi\\'kmaq resistance leaders capitalized. British relations with the Mi\\'kmaq after the war developed in the context of British expansion in Nova Scotia and also along the Maine coast, where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands, often in violation of previous treaties. Neither the Abenakis nor the Mi\\'kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht, and the 1713 Portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by the New England signatories, so the Mi\\'kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands. This conflict was increased by French intriguers such as Sébastien Rale, and eventually they developed into Father Rale\\'s War (1722–1727). British relations were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French leaders such as Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi\\'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia. Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia\\'s borders. The boundaries were unclear as laid out by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula was included in the treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick. The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George\\'s War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years\\' War. Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on the front line of the war, yet the New England colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown\\'s military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition. Spanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population from the effects of the war, and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years\\' War. Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina\\'s viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina. James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois. The economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations. The French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico, renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish. Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out. The first Indian War was King Philip\\'s War, the second was King William\\'s War, and the fourth was Father Rale\\'s War.

It was fought on four fronts:\\n# In the south, [[Spanish Florida]] and the English [[Province of Carolina]] attacked one another, and English colonists engaged French colonists based at [[Mobile, Alabama]], with allied Indians on both sides. The southern war did not result in significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida and parts of southern Georgia, and destroying the network of [[Spanish missions in Florida]].\\n# In [[New England]], English colonists fought against French colonists and Indian forces in [[Acadia]] and [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]. [[Quebec City]] was repeatedly targeted by British colonial expeditions, and the Acadian capital [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] was [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|captured in 1710]]. The French colonists and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] sought to thwart British expansion into Acadia, whose border [[New France]] defined as the [[Kennebec River]] in what is now southern [[Maine]].<ref name=\"William Williamson 1832. p. 27\">William Williamson. \\'\\'The history of the state of Maine\\'\\'.

Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids on settlements. The French colonists [[Battle of St. John\\'s|successfully captured St. John\\'s]] in 1709, but the British colonists quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it.\\n# French privateers based in Acadia and Placentia captured many ships from New England\\'s fishing and shipping industries. Privateers took 102 prizes into Placentia, second only to [[Martinique]] in France\\'s American colonies. The naval conflict ended with the capture of Acadia (Nova Scotia).<ref>Donald F.

France ceded the territories of [[Hudson Bay]], Acadia, and Newfoundland to Britain while retaining [[Cape Breton Island]] and other islands in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. Some terms were ambiguous in the treaty, and the concerns of various Indian tribes were not included, thereby setting the stage for future conflicts.\\n\\n==Background==\\n{{details|topic=causes of the war in Europe|War of the Spanish Succession}}\\n[[File:Recognition of the Duke of Anjou as King of Spain.png|thumb|left|[[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]] proclaimed as the King of Spain in November 1700. A dispute over his succession led to war between the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] alliance.]]\\nWhen [[War of the Spanish Succession|war broke out]] in Europe in 1701 following the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] concerning who should succeed him to the Spanish throne, it was initially restricted to a few powers in Europe, but it widened in May 1702 when England declared war on Spain and France.<ref>Thomas, pp. 405–407</ref> Both the British and French wanted to keep their American colonies neutral, but they did not reach an agreement.<ref>Evarts Boutell Greene, \\'\\'Provincial America, 1690–1740\\'\\' (1905) pp 140–41.</ref> But the American colonists had their own tensions which had been growing along the borders separating the French and English colonies, especially concerning boundaries and governing authority in the northern and southwestern frontiers of the [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonies]], which stretched from the [[Province of Carolina]] in the south to the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and at [[Hudson Bay]].<ref>Stone, pp. 161, 165</ref>\\n\\nThe total population of the English colonies was about 250,000, with [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[New England]] dominating.<ref>Craven, p. 288</ref> The residents were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching as far as the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>See Winsor, p. 341, showing a 1687 map of the southeastern colonies</ref> Colonists knew little of the interior of the continent to the west of the Appalachians and south of the [[Great Lakes]]. This area was dominated by Indian tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated it. Spanish missionaries in \\'\\'[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]\\'\\' had established a [[Spanish missions in Florida|network of missions]] to convert the Indians to Roman Catholicism.<ref>Weber, pp. 100–107</ref> The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indian population to whom they ministered has been estimated at 20,000.<ref>Cooper and Terrill, p. 22</ref> French explorers had located the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], and they established a small colonial presence at [[Fort Maurepas]] near [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], in 1699.<ref>Weber, p. 158</ref> From there, they began to build trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the [[Choctaw]], a large tribe whose enemies included the British-allied [[Chickasaw]].<ref>Crane, p. 385</ref> All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]] by early explorers and traders.<ref>Waselkov and Hatley, p. 104</ref>\\n\\nThe arrival of French colonists in the south threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides of the recently ended [[Nine Years\\' War]].<ref>Weber, pp. 158–159</ref> Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the [[Savannah River]] were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic colonists of New Spain and the Protestant colonists along the coast.<ref name=Arnade32>Arnade, p. 32</ref>\\n\\nTo the north, the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes. Newfoundland was the site of a British colony at [[St. John\\'s, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John\\'s]] and a French colony at [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance]], with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe.<ref>Drake, p. 115</ref> These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]) and Massachusetts.<ref>Pope, pp. 202–203<!--population figures--></ref><ref>Drake, p. 115,203</ref>\\n\\nThe borders and boundaries remained uncertain between [[Acadia]] and New England despite battles along the border throughout [[King William\\'s War]]. [[New France]] defined the border of Acadia as the [[Kennebec River]] in southern [[Maine]].<ref name=\"William Williamson 1832. p. 27\"/> There were Catholic missions at [[Norridgewock]] and [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Penobscot]] and a French settlement in [[Penobscot Bay]] near [[Castine, Maine]], which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William\\'s War.<ref>Drake, p. 36</ref> The frontier areas between the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and [[Province of New York|New York]] were still dominated by Indians, primarily [[Abenaki]] and [[Iroquois]], and the [[Hudson River]]–[[Lake Champlain]] corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements.<ref>Drake, p. 150</ref>\\n\\nThe Hudson Bay territories (also known as [[Prince Rupert\\'s Land]]) were not significantly fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|French attack]] on the outpost of [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]] in 1709.<ref>Newman, pp. 87<!--name of rupert\\'s land-->,109–124</ref><ref>Bryce, p. 58</ref> The [[Hudson\\'s Bay Company]] was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied for their return in the negotiations that ended this war.<ref>Newman, pp. 127–128</ref>\\n\\n==Technology and organization==\\nMilitary technology used in America was not as developed as in Europe. Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications at the start of the war, such as [[St. Augustine, Florida]], [[Boston]], [[Quebec City]], and [[St. John\\'s, Newfoundland and Labrador]], although [[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port Royal\\'s]] fortifications were completed early in the war.<ref>Shurtleff, p. 492<!--Boston-->; MacVicar, p. 45<!--Port Royal-->; Arnade, p. 32<!--St. Augustine-->; Prowse, pp. 211<!--Plaisance-->,223<!--St. John\\'s--></ref> Some villages and settlements were protected by wooden [[palisade]]s, but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with [[Embrasure|gun ports]] through which defenders could fire, and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below.<ref>Leckie, p. 231</ref> Europeans and colonists were typically armed with smooth-bore muskets that had a maximum range of about {{convert|100|yd|m}} but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance. Some colonists also carried pikes, while Indian warriors either carried arms supplied by the colonists or were armed with weapons such as primitive [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]] and bows. A small number of colonists had training in the operation of cannon and other types of artillery which were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses.<ref name=Pec26>Peckham, p. 26</ref>\\n[[File:PortRoyalAcadia1702.jpg|thumb|left|Stone fortifications of [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]], [[Acadia]], 1702. Few settlements had stone fortification at the start of the war.]]\\nEnglish colonists were generally organized into militia companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence<ref name=Pec26/> beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland.<ref name=Prowse223>Prowse, p. 223</ref> The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the [[troupes de la marine]]. This force consisted of some experienced officers and was manned by recruits sent over from France numbering between 500 and 1,200. They were spread throughout the territories of New France, with concentrations in the major population centers.<ref>Peckham, p. 27</ref> Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indians in their territory and not to provide them with weapons.

       "  'text': 'Abel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch:\\xa0[ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn]; 1603\\xa0– 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer, explorer, and merchant, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was the first known European explorer to reach the islands of Van Diemen\\'s Land (now Tasmania), Fiji and New Zealand. Abel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city. Employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Tasman sailed from Texel to Batavia, now Jakarta, in 1633 taking the southern Brouwer Route. During this period, Tasman took part in a voyage to Seram Island; the locals had sold spices to other European nationalities than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by people of Seram. In August 1637, Tasman was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the Jordaan, but the purchase was cancelled. He was second-in-command of a 1639 exploration expedition in the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast. The fleet included the ships Engel and Gracht and reached Fort Zeelandia (Dutch Formosa) and Deshima. In August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of Antonie van Diemen, Cornelis van der Lijn, Joan Maetsuycker, Justus Schouten, Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia despatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the Cape of Good Hope, west of Staten Land (near the Cape Horn of South America) and south of the Solomon Islands. One of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of \"all the totally unknown\" Provinces of Beach. This was a purported yet non-existent landmass alleged to have plentiful gold, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century, as a result of an error in some editions of Marco Polo\\'s works. The expedition was to use two small ships, Heemskerck and Zeehaen. In accordance with Visscher\\'s directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 and arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain\\'s journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds, Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island, both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November, snow and hail influenced the ship\\'s council to alter course to a more north-easterly direction, expecting to arrive one day at the Solomon Islands. On 24 November 1642, Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen\\'s Land, after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south, Tasman skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. He then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island, where he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later, on December 1, Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. On December 2, two ship\\'s boats under the command of the Pilot, Major Visscher, rowed through the Marion Narrows into Blackman Bay, and across the west to the outflow of Boomer Creek where they gathered some edible \"greens\". Tasman named Frederick Hendrik Bay, which included the present North Bay, Marion Bay and the inlet Blackman Bay (the name Frederick Henry Bay was mistakenly transferred to its present location by Marion Dufresne in 1772). The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough, the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land, on 3 December 1642. For two more days, he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. The impenetrable wind wall indicated that here was a strait, not a bay. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting. After some exploration, Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. The expedition endured an extremely rough voyage and in one of his diary entries Tasman credited his compass, claiming it was the only thing that had kept him alive. On 13 December 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island, New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to sight New Zealand. Tasman named it Staten Landt \"in honour of the States General\" (Dutch parliament). He wrote, \"it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Landt but it is uncertain\", referring to Isla de los Estados, a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, encountered by the Dutch navigator Jacob Le Maire in 1616. However, in 1643 Brouwer\\'s expedition to Valdivia found out that Staaten Landt was separated by sea from any the hypothetical Southern Land. Tasman continued: \"We believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown Southland.\" Tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined Terra Australis that stretched across the Pacific to near the southern tip of South America. After sailing north, then east for five days, the expedition anchored about 7\\xa0km from the coast off what is now believed to have been Golden Bay. Tasman sent ship\\'s boats to gather water, but one of his boats was attacked by Māori in a double-hulled waka (canoe) and four of his men were killed with mere (clubs). In the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore, two of which betook themselves towards us. When our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water, and with the sinking of the sun (which sank behind the high land) they had been still about half a mile from the shore. After our people had been on board about one glass, people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff, hollow voices. We could not in the least understand any of it; however, when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer. But they did not come nearer than a stone\\'s shot. They also blew many times on an instrument, which produced a sound like the moors\\' trumpets. We had one of our sailors (who could play somewhat on the trumpet) play some tunes to them in answer.\" As Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which \"eleven swarming with people came off towards us.\" The waka approached the Zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. Canister shot also hit the side of a waka. Archaeological research has shown the Dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori may have been trying to protect. Tasman named the area \"Murderers\\' Bay\". The expedition then sailed north, sighting Cook Strait, which it mistook for a bight and named \"Zeehaen\\'s Bight\". Two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of New Zealand still endure: Cape Maria van Diemen and Three Kings Islands. (Kaap Pieter Boreels was renamed Cape Egmont by Captain James Cook 125 years later.) En route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman\\'s ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia before making his way back into the open sea. The expedition turned north-west towards New Guinea and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643. Tasman left Batavia on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of New Holland. However, he missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on New Holland and its people. He arrived back in Batavia in August 1644. From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman\\'s explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman did not fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans – mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident. On 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now Thailand) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to Manila to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage. In his will (dating from 1657), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village Lutjegast. Although Tasman\\'s pilot, Frans Visscher, published Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land in 1642, Tasman\\'s detailed journal was not published until 1898; however, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers. Tasman\\'s ten-month voyage in 1642–43 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman\\'s suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769. Multiple places have been named after Tasman, including: the Australian island and state of Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen\\'s land. It includes features such as: the Tasman Peninsula the Tasman Bridge the Tasman Highway the Tasman Sea in New Zealand: the Tasman Glacier Tasman Lake the Tasman River Mount Tasman the Abel Tasman National Park Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere the Tasman District Also named after Tasman are: Tasman Pulp and Paper company, A large pulp and paper producer in Kawerau New Zealand Abel Tasman Drive, in Takaka The former passenger/vehicle ferry Abel Tasman The Able Tasmans – an indie band from Auckland, New Zealand Tasman, a layout engine for Internet Explorer 6594 Tasman (1987 MM1), a main-belt asteroid Tasman Drive in San Jose, California, and its Tasman light rail station Tasman Road in Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa HMNZS Tasman Shore based training Establishment of the Royal New Zealand Navy HMAS Tasman is a Hunter-class frigate that is expected to enter service with the Royal Australian Navy in the late 2020s. His portrait has been on four New Zealand postage stamp issues, on a 1992 5 NZD coin, and on 1963, 1966 and 1985 Australian postage stamps. In the Netherlands, many streets are named after him. In Lutjegast, the village he was born, there is a museum dedicated to his life and travels. Held within the collection of the State Library of New South Wales is the Tasman Map, thought to have been drawn by Isaac Gilsemans, or completed under the supervision of Franz Jacobszoon Visscher. The map is also known as the Bonaparte map, as it was once owned by Prince Roland Bonaparte, the great-nephew of Napoleon. The map was completed sometime after 1644 and is based on the original charts drawn during Tasman\\'s first and second voyages. As none of the journals or logs composed during Tasman\\'s second voyage have survived, the Bonaparte map remains as an important contemporary artefact of Tasman\\'s voyage to the northern coast of the Australian continent. The Tasman map largely reveals the extent of understanding the Dutch had of the Australian continent at the time. The map includes the western and southern coasts of Australia, accidentally encountered by Dutch voyagers as they journeyed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to the VOC headquarters in Batavia. In addition, the map shows the tracks of Tasman\\'s two voyages. Of his second voyage, the map shows the area of the Banda Islands, the southern coast of New Guinea and much of the northern coast of Australia. However, the area of the Torres Strait is shown unexamined; this is despite having been given orders by VOC Council at Batavia to explore the possibility of a channel between New Guinea and the Australian continent. There is debate as to the origin of the map. It is widely believed that the map was produced in Batavia; however, it has also been argued that the map was produced in Amsterdam. The authorship of the map has also been debated: while the map is commonly attributed to Tasman, it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration, probably involving Franchoijs Visscher and Isaack Gilsemans, who took part in both of Tasman\\'s voyages. Whether the map was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate, as a VOC company report in December 1644 suggests that at that time no maps showing Tasman\\'s voyages were yet complete. In 1943, a mosaic version of the map, composed of coloured marble and brass, was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the Mitchell Library in Sydney. The work was commissioned by the Principal\\xa0Librarian William Ifould, and completed by the Melocco Brothers of Annandale, who also worked on ANZAC War Memorial in Hyde Park and the crypt at St Mary\\'s Cathedral, Sydney.

       "     'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already [[Count of Angoulême]] after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of [[Duke of Valois]].<ref name=\"Knecht3\" />\\n\\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter [[Claude of France|Claude]] and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 8–9.</ref> Claude was heir presumptive to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] through her mother, [[Anne of Brittany]]. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 11.</ref> On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the [[Cathedral of Reims]] on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his [[Queen consort of France|queen consort]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 16.</ref>\\n\\n==Reign==\\n[[File:François 1515.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Francis I painted in 1515]]\\n[[File:Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, 1494-1547, King of France 1515 (obverse), 1515 or after, NGA 44648.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, (obverse)]]\\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\"<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Francis I. of France | volume=10 |page=935 |first=Jules |last=Isaac |authorlink=Jules Isaac}}</ref> In the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1971) p. 314.</ref> during the reign of [[Louis XI, King of France|Louis XI]].  Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canada Quebec 1534–2000|last=Lacoursière|first=Jacques|publisher=Septentrion|year=2005|isbn=978-2894481868|location=Québec|page=28}}</ref>\\n\\nIn order to counterbalance the power of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the [[New World]] through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n\\nThe port city now known as [[Le Havre]] was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]], whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named \\'\\'Franciscopolis\\'\\' after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\\n\\n====Americas====\\n{{further|France-Americas relations}}\\nIn 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of [[Lyon]] in financing the expedition of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of [[New York City]], naming it [[New Angoulême]], and claimed [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the French crown.

This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts.

He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V.

The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed.

Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian [[Jules Michelet]] set the negative image.<ref>Robert J. Knecht, \"\\'Born between two women...\\'Jules Michelet and Francis I.\" \\'\\'Renaissance Studies\\'\\' (2000) 14#3: 329-343 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24412871 online]</ref>\\n\\nFrancis\\' personal emblem was the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] and his Latin motto was \\'\\'Nutrisco et extinguo\\'\\' (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\").<ref>Richardson, 2015.</ref> His long nose earned him the nickname \\'\\'François du Grand Nez\\'\\' (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as \\'\\'le Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (\"the Knight-King\") or the \\'\\'le Roi-Guerrier\\'\\' (\"the Warrior-King\").<ref>[[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] [https://archive.is/20130213110523/http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Laroussefr_-_Article/11020086]</ref>\\n\\nBritish historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:\\n:He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]]. The couple had seven children:\\n* Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] almost from birth until death.\\n* [[Charlotte of Valois|Charlotte]] (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] from 1518 until death.\\n* [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless.\\n* [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559).

The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was [[Françoise de Foix]], Countess of [[Châteaubriant]]. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly [[Mary Boleyn]], mistress of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450</ref>\\n\\n==Francis I in films, stage and literature==\\nThe amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by [[Fanny Kemble]], \\'\\'Francis the First\\'\\', and the 1832 play by [[Victor Hugo]], \\'\\'[[Le Roi s\\'amuse]]\\'\\' (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester [[Triboulet]], the inspiration for the 1851 opera \\'\\'[[Rigoletto (opera)|Rigoletto]]\\'\\' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].\\n\\nFrancis was first played in a [[George Méliès]] movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), [[Aimé Simon-Girard]] (1937), [[Sacha Guitry]] (1937), [[Gérard Oury]] (1953), [[Jean Marais]] (1955), [[Pedro Armendáriz]] (1956), [[Claude Titre]] (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). [[Timothy West]] (1998) and [[Emmanuel Leconte]] (2007– 2010).\\n\\nFrancis was portrayed by [[Peter Gilmore]] in the comedy film \\'\\'[[Carry On Henry]]\\'\\' charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis).\\n\\nFrancis receives a mention in a minor story in [[Laurence Sterne]]\\'s novel \\'\\'[[Tristram Shandy]]\\'\\'. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\\n\\nHe is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel \\'\\'Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé\\'\\', where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\\n\\nHe often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – [[Mary Boleyn]] (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels \\'\\'The Lady in the Tower\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],\\'\\' \\'\\'The Last Boleyn\\'\\', \\'\\'Dear Heart, How Like You This?\\'\\' and \\'\\'Mademoiselle Boleyn\\'\\' feature Francis in their story. He appears in [[Hilary Mantel]]\\'s \\'\\'Wolf Hall\\'\\' about Henry VIII\\'s minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] and is often referred to in its sequel, \\'\\'Bring Up the Bodies\\'\\'.\\n\\nFrancis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel \\'\\'Courtesan\\'\\' about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.\\n\\nFrancis appears as the patron of [[Benvenuto Cellini]] in the 1843 French novel \\'\\'L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio\\'\\' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].\\n\\n[[Samuel Shellabarger]]\\'s novel \\'\\'The King\\'s Cavalier\\'\\' describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.\\n\\nHe was a recurring character in the Showtime series \\'\\'[[The Tudors]]\\'\\', opposite [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte.\\n\\nHe and his court set the scene for [[Friedrich Schiller]]\\'s ballad \\'\\'[[Der Handschuh]]\\'\\' (\\'\\'The Glove\\'\\').\\n\\nFrancis I (played by [[Timothy West]]) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by [[Dougray Scott]]) are central figures in the 1998 movie \\'\\'[[Ever After]]\\'\\', a retelling of the [[Cinderella]] story.  The plot includes [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (played by [[Patrick Godfrey]]) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\'.\\n\\nHe is played by [[Alfonso Bassave]] in the [[Televisión Española|TVE]] series \\'\\'[[Carlos, rey emperador]]\\'\\', opposite [[Álvaro Cervantes]] as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].\\n\\n==Ancestors==\\n{{ahnentafel\\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\\n| 1 = 1. \\'\\'\\'Francis I of France\\'\\'\\'\\n| 2 = 2.

A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

He was the son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]]. He succeeded his first cousin once removed [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], who died without a son.\\n\\nA prodigious [[patron of the arts]], he promoted the emergent [[French Renaissance]] by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who brought the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of [[humanism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the beginning of French exploration of the [[New World]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already [[Count of Angoulême]] after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of [[Duke of Valois]].<ref name=\"Knecht3\" />\\n\\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter [[Claude of France|Claude]] and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 8–9.</ref> Claude was heir presumptive to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] through her mother, [[Anne of Brittany]]. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 11.</ref> On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the [[Cathedral of Reims]] on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his [[Queen consort of France|queen consort]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 16.</ref>\\n\\n==Reign==\\n[[File:François 1515.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Francis I painted in 1515]]\\n[[File:Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, 1494-1547, King of France 1515 (obverse), 1515 or after, NGA 44648.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, (obverse)]]\\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France.

The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]].

This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII.

This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts.

He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V.

The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile.

He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]].

       "  'opening_text': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

       "     'text': 'Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879\\xa0– 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\" Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein\\'s father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later. In 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school\\'s regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor\\'s note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\". Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time \"[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\" His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\". At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason, and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: \"At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant\\'s works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\" In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler\\'s daughter, Marie. Albert\\'s sister Maja later married Winteler\\'s son Paul. In January 1896, with his father\\'s approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post. Einstein\\'s future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein\\'s and Marić\\'s friendship developed into romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra-curricular physics in which they were both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Marić that he preferred studying alongside her. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal teaching diploma. There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate Marić might have collaborated with Einstein prior to his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies, although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions. Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named \"Lieserl\", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein\\'s letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy. Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that despite their close relationship before, Einstein\\'s chief romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal; she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein transferred his Nobel Prize fund to Marić when he won it. Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\" He spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, after having a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936. In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton). Among Einstein\\'s well-known friends were Michele Besso, Paul Ehrenfest, Marcel Grossmann, János Plesch, Daniel Q. Posin, Maurice Solovine, Stephen Samuel Wise and Fritz Haber. After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but for medical reasons was not conscripted. With the help of Marcel Grossmann\\'s father, he secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner – level III. Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\". Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical–mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time. With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook. In 1900, Einstein\\'s paper \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena\") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions. Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein\\'s annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26. By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909. Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann. When the ″Manifesto of the Ninety-Three″ was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany\\'s militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic ″Manifesto to the Europeans″. On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership[clarification needed] in the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established. Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus Berlin University[clarification needed] on 1 April 1914.[clarification needed] As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918). Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun\\'s gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science\\xa0– New Theory of the Universe\\xa0– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\". In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921. He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925. Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King\\'s College London. He also published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America (1835). For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\" In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. In his own travel diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018. Because of Einstein\\'s travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist. On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein\\'s talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world. Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences. From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924), a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals. Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values. Einstein\\'s former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee. In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all. After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\". Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York\\'s Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism\", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech\\'s students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good. This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein\\'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy\". Chaplin\\'s film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein\\'s biographer, described this as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity\". Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was \"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis\". In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany\\'s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler. While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family\\'s apartment in Berlin. He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which was passed on 23 March and transformed Hitler\\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp. In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed. A month later, Einstein\\'s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, \"...\\xa0I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\" After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\". Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933. Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the Allies\\' technology ahead of theirs. Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey\\'s Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein\\'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\". Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany\\'s treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar. In October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s. Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship. Einstein\\'s affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group\\'s warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. The letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. For Einstein, \"war was a disease\\xa0... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them\\xa0...\" In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education. Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\", seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next\". As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case. In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925 and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel\\'s first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \"deeply moved\", and \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it. Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music.\" His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age. When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\" At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\" Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart\\'s work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation. In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart\\'s works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein\\'s level of coordination and intonation\". In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. However, later in his life, Einstein\\'s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\" His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \\'well-regulated system of government\\' and called their rule a \\'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\\'. He later adopted a more balanced view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind\\'s conscience.\" Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long. Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he exchanged written letters. He described Gandhi as \"a role model for the generations to come\". Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews. Einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza\\'s philosophy. He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\". When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, \"No. And one life is enough for me.\" Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without \\'ethical culture\\' there is no salvation for humanity.\" In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote: The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything \\'chosen\\' about them. On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel\\'s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it. Einstein refused surgery, saying, \"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\" He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end. During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein\\'s brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein\\'s remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965, at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: \"He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness\\xa0... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.\" Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein\\'s papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein\\'s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others. The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are: Einstein\\'s first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena. Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter. Einstein\\'s \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell\\'s equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein\\'s writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown. This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous. In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E\\xa0=\\xa0mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck. Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski\\'s formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity. General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light. In 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally. In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed. The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein\\'s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction. While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only. In June 1913, the Entwurf (\\'draft\\') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of Mach\\'s principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein\\'s static universe. Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\". In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated. In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel\\'s [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\" It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea. General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether\\'s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether\\'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others. In 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches. If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way. In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s. The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein field equations, which describe how space curves. The geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations. Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself. This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects. In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein\\'s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan\\'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering. Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck\\'s constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect. In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model. Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements. Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics. In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose\\'s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose\\'s paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein\\'s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University. Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck\\'s energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck\\'s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie\\'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger\\'s work of 1926. Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete. The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics. In 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the \"EPR paper\". In a thought experiment, he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. Given Einstein\\'s concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\"). Einstein\\'s belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell\\'s theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\" Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory. Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"unified field theory\" in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\". Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein\\'s approaches to unification. Einstein\\'s dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting. Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research. In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists. Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron\\'s angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization. Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.[citation needed] This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation. In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux. While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University\\'s Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university. The Einstein rights were litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the Einstein rights had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The court\\'s initial decision no longer has any legal impact or effect of any kind. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The Einstein rights are enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of those rights. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\" Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine\\'s Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist\\'s dream come true\". Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him. Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.

Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss [[Federal Polytechnic School]] in [[Zürich]] in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a [[patent examiner]] at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]].\\n\\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of [[classical mechanics]] could no longer be reconciled with those of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led him to develop his [[special theory of relativity]] during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his \\'\\'[[annus mirabilis]]\\'\\' (\\'miracle year\\'), he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]] which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained [[Brownian motion]], the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zurich]].\\n\\nAlthough initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the [[University of Bern]] in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to [[Charles University in Prague]] before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]], where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.<ref name=\"Nobel\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20151124\" />\\n\\nIn 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power. Because of his [[Jewish]] background, Einstein did not return to Germany.<ref name=\"zE9Bz\" /> He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.<ref name=\"BoyerDubofsky2001\" /> On the eve of [[World War II]], he endorsed [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential [[German nuclear weapons program]] and recommending that the US begin [[Manhattan Project|similar research]]. Einstein supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but generally denounced the idea of [[nuclear weapons]].\\n\\nEinstein was affiliated with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], until his death in 1955.

In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein\\'s father and his uncle Jakob founded \\'\\'Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie\\'\\', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name=\"Bio\" />\\n\\nThe Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59–61]}}\\n\\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref name=\"EQyag\" /> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school\\'s regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor\\'s note.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=30–31}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether (classical element)|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field\".{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref name=\"1RgTv\" />\\n\\nEinstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.

Later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in [[Antwerp]], Belgium on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a [[Hitler Youth]] camp.<ref name=\"el4GB\" />\\n\\n==== Refugee status ====\\n[[File:Einstein\\'s landing card (5706142737).jpg|thumb|Albert Einstein\\'s landing card (26 May 1933), when he landed in [[Dover]] (United Kingdom) from [[Ostende]] (Belgium) to visit [[Oxford]].]]\\nIn April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} Historian [[Gerald Holton]] describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.{{sfnp|Holton|1984|p=}}\\n\\nA month later, Einstein\\'s works were among those targeted by the [[German Student Union]] in the [[Nazi book burnings]], with Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\"{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}}<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend [[Max Born]], who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, \"...&nbsp;I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\"{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1954|p=197}}\\n\\nEinstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his {{w|Cromer}} home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of {{w|Roughton, Norfolk}}. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the \\'\\'Daily Herald\\'\\' on 24 July 1933.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}<ref name=\"3zIp7\" />\\n\\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=419–420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.<ref name=\"Gilbert\" /> Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]\\' technology ahead of theirs.<ref name=\"Gilbert\" />\\n\\nEinstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including [[Turkey]]\\'s Prime Minister, [[İsmet İnönü]], to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein\\'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".<ref name=\"aDu8s\" />\\n\\nLocker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} In one of his speeches he denounced Germany\\'s treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.<ref name=\"AP\" /> In his speech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"gnriE\" /><ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], US, to become a resident scholar.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}\\n\\n==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====\\n[[File:Einstein-formal portrait-35.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Einstein taken in 1935 at Princeton]]\\nIn October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study,{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=649, 678}} noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref name=\"Arntzenius2011\" /> At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their [[Jewish quota]]s, which lasted until the late 1940s.<ref name=\"Arntzenius2011\" />\\n\\nEinstein was still undecided on his future.

The two would take long walks together discussing their work. [[Bruria Kaufman]], his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully.\\n\\n==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====\\n{{See also|Einstein–Szilárd letter}}\\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group\\'s warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\"{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=630}}<ref name=\"o4fkQ\" /> To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.<ref name=\"pRqWK\" /> He was asked to lend his support by writing [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]], with Szilárd, to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\\n\\nThe letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\".<ref name=\"4Z68g\" /> In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the [[Belgian Royal Family]]<ref name=\"eZym8\" /> and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]].\\n\\nFor Einstein, \"war was a disease&nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.<ref name=\"z73PK\" /> In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them&nbsp;...\"{{Sfnp|Clark|1971|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], signed [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto|a manifesto]] highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.\\n\\n==== US citizenship ====\\n[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting [[Citizenship of the United States|US citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]\\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=432}}\\n\\nEinstein joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[Civil rights movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\",<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next\".{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2005|pp=148–149}} As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist [[W.

That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=161}} Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=158}}\\n\\nChaim Weizmann later became Israel\\'s first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of [[Ezriel Carlebach]], Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] offered Einstein the position of [[President of Israel]], a mostly ceremonial post.<ref name=\"Time\" /><ref name=\"Msb2q\" /> The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, [[Abba Eban]], who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}} Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \"deeply moved\", and \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}}\\n\\n==== Love of music ====\\n[[File:Rabindranath with Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein (right) with writer, musician and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1930]]\\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music.\"<ref name=\"BQH5A\" /><ref name=\"aBOjz\" />\\n\\nHis mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\\n\\nWhen he turned 13, he discovered the [[Mozart violin sonatas|violin sonatas of Mozart]], whereupon he became enamored of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\"<ref name=\"Botstein\" /> At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing [[Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas (disambiguation)<!-- intentional -->|Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas]]. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\"<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\\n\\nMusic took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Köchel catalog]] of Mozart\\'s work; that edition was prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]], who may have been a distant relation.<ref name=\"kGuWC\" /><ref name=\"OIn6p\" />\\n\\nIn 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and Mozart\\'s works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].<ref name=\"Times\" /><ref name=\"RR\" /> Near the end of his life, when the young [[Juilliard Quartet]] visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein\\'s level of coordination and intonation\".<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\\n\\n==== Political and religious views ====\\n{{Main|Political views of Albert Einstein|Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein}}\\n[[File:Einsteinwiezmann.PNG|alt=Casual group shot of four men and two women standing on a brick pavement.|thumb|Albert Einstein with his wife [[Elsa Einstein]] and Zionist leaders, including future [[President of Israel]] [[Chaim Weizmann]], his wife [[Vera Weizmann]], [[Menahem Ussishkin]], and Ben-Zion Mossinson on arrival in New York City in 1921]]\\n\\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the [[German Democratic Party]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]] party.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=83}} However, later in his life, Einstein\\'s political view was in favor of [[socialism]] and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"[[Why Socialism?]]\"{{sfnp|Einstein|1949}}<ref name=\"LXsUJ\"/> His opinions on the [[Bolsheviks]] also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \\'well-regulated system of government\\' and called their rule a \\'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\\'. He later adopted a more balanced view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on [[Vladimir Lenin]]: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind\\'s conscience.\"{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_X1dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA413 412, 413]}} Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic [[World government|global government]] that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=487, 494, 550}} The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.<ref name=\"ixWWZ\" />\\n\\nEinstein was deeply impressed by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with whom he exchanged written letters.

He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]],<ref name=\"mKToJ\" /> and was an honorary associate of the [[Rationalist Association]], which publishes \\'\\'[[New Humanist]]\\'\\' in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]], he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without \\'ethical culture\\' there is no salvation for humanity.\"{{sfnp|Einstein|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fJkBqwDD3sC&pg=PA62 62]}}\\n\\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher [[Eric Gutkind]], dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:<blockquote>The word [[God (word)|God]] is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the [[Bible]] a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the [[Jewish religion]] like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions.

It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=\"PubList\" />\\n\\n==== Theory of critical opalescence ====\\n{{Main|Critical opalescence}}\\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref name=\"L2N73\" /> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\\n\\n=== Special relativity ===\\n{{Main|History of special relativity}}\\nEinstein\\'s \"\\'\\'Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\\'\\'\"{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}} (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between [[Maxwell\\'s equations]] (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=178–198}} Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein\\'s writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work.

In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of [[spacetime]]. Einstein adopted Minkowski\\'s formalism in his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=151–152}}\\n\\n=== General relativity ===\\n\\n==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====\\n{{Main|History of general relativity}}\\n{{See also|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}\\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]\\'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\\n\\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179–183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900–1909|pp=273–274}}\\n\\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194–195}}\\n\\n====Gravitational waves====\\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,{{sfnp|Einstein|1916}}{{sfnp|Einstein|1918}} ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\\n\\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /><ref name=\"Tf1T0\" /> Einstein\\'s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at [[LIGO]] published the [[first observation of gravitational waves]],<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\" /> detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /><ref name=\"CO6kH\" /><ref name=\"oSmHb\" /><ref name=\"hkKSp\" /><ref name=\"38Msx\" />\\n\\n==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====\\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\\n\\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\\'draft\\') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref name=\"sOA9t\" /> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\\n\\n==== Physical cosmology ====\\n{{Main|Physical cosmology}}\\n[[File:MillikanLemaitreEinstein.jpg|thumb|right|Einstein with [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in January 1933.]]\\n\\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of [[Mach\\'s principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein\\'s static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285–286}}<ref name=\"iJwuX\" />\\n\\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name=\"cor-2013\" /> and the [[Einstein–de Sitter universe]] of 1932.{{sfnp|Einstein|de Sitter|1932}}<ref name=\"J9Tqu\" /> In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name=\"cor-2013\" /><ref name=\"sxfvo\" />\\n\\nIn many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.<ref name=\"qmmVf\" />\\n\\nIn late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the universe.<ref name=\"Tq53z\" /><ref name=\"8pfEk\" /> In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\" /><ref name=\"Einstein\\'s aborted model\" /> As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel\\'s [\\'\\'sic\\'\\'] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"\\n\\nIt thus appears that Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.<ref name=\"ILjYQ\" /><ref name=\"ThZb0\" /> However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\" /><ref name=\"Einstein\\'s aborted model\" /><ref name=\"7ShC9\" />\\n\\n==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====\\n{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}\\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether\\'s theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether\\'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\\n\\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\\n\\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.\\n\\n==== Wormholes ====\\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein–Rosen bridges]].{{sfnp|Einstein|Rosen|1935}}<ref name=\"QNjpt\" /> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.<ref name=\"ja7FY\" />\\n\\nIf one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\\n\\n==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====\\n{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}\\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\\n\\n==== Equations of motion ====\\n{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}\\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law{{mdash}}the [[Einstein field equations]], which describe how space curves. The [[geodesic equation]], which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.\\n\\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\\n\\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\\n\\n=== Old quantum theory ===\\n{{Main|Old quantum theory}}\\n\\n==== Photons and energy quanta ====\\n[[File:Photoelectric effect in a solid - diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\\nIn a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (\\'\\'[[quantum|quanta]]\\'\\'). Einstein\\'s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]\\'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\\n\\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency \\'\\'f\\'\\' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy \\'\\'hf\\'\\' each, where \\'\\'h\\'\\' is [[Planck\\'s constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\\n\\n==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====\\n{{Main|Einstein solid}}\\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref name=\"ixm32\" />\\n\\n==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====\\n{{main|Adiabatic invariant}}\\nThroughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\\n\\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien\\'s displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.\\n\\n==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====\\n{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}\\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose\\'s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose\\'s paper to the \\'\\'[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]\\'\\'. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref name=\"nlagl\" /> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein\\'s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<ref name=\"Instituut-Lorentz\" />\\n\\n==== Wave–particle duality ====\\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]\\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a \\'\\'[[Privatdozent]]\\'\\' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In \"\\'\\'Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\\'\\'\" (\"[[s:Translation:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]\"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck\\'s energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the \\'\\'photon\\'\\' concept (although the name \\'\\'photon\\'\\' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\\n\\n==== Zero-point energy ====\\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of [[zero-point energy]] in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912–1914|pp=270ff}}\\n\\n==== Stimulated emission ====\\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in \\'\\'Physikalische Zeitschrift\\'\\' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck\\'s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\\n\\n==== Matter waves ====\\nEinstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]\\'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger\\'s work of 1926.\\n\\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\\n==== Einstein\\'s objections to quantum mechanics ====\\n[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]\\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\".<ref name=\"zZ2hS\" /> Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.<ref name=\"yzZtL\" />\\n\\n==== Bohr versus Einstein ====\\n{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}\\n[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks skeptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name=\"Bohr1949\" />{{Sfnp|Einstein|1969}}{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} Their debates would influence later [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].\\n\\n==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====\\nIn 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the [[EPR paradox|\"EPR paper\"]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} In a [[Einstein\\'s thought experiments|thought experiment]], he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448–453}}\\n\\nGiven Einstein\\'s concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448–453}}\\n\\nEinstein\\'s belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell\\'s theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}\\n\\nAlthough Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|\\'\\'entangled quantum states\\'\\']], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]]. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}\\n\\n=== Unified field theory ===\\n{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}\\nFollowing his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified field theory]]\" in a \\'\\'[[Scientific American]]\\'\\' article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\\nIn his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein\\'s approaches to unification. Einstein\\'s dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\\n\\n=== Other investigations ===\\n{{Main|Einstein\\'s unsuccessful investigations}}\\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.\\n\\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world\\'s top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]\\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\\n\\n==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====\\n{{Main|Einstein–de Haas effect}}\\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron\\'s angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\\n\\n==== Schrödinger gas model ====\\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\\n\\nThis formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref name=\"4IMf2\" />\\n\\n==== Einstein refrigerator ====\\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.<ref name=\"Goettling\" /> On 11 November 1930, {{US patent|1781541}} was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]].{{refn |group=note |In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator.

       "     'opening_text': 'Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879\\xa0– 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\".

His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula <span><i>E</i> = <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup></span>, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.\\n</p><p>The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.\\n</p><p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his <i>annus mirabilis</i> (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.\\n</p><p>Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.</p><p>In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.\\n</p><p>Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\"</p>',\n",

       "     'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

He was the son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]]. He succeeded his first cousin once removed [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], who died without a son.\\n\\nA prodigious [[patron of the arts]], he promoted the emergent [[French Renaissance]] by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who brought the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of [[humanism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the beginning of French exploration of the [[New World]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].

Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W.

Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canada Quebec 1534–2000|last=Lacoursière|first=Jacques|publisher=Septentrion|year=2005|isbn=978-2894481868|location=Québec|page=28}}</ref>\\n\\nIn order to counterbalance the power of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the [[New World]] through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n\\nThe port city now known as [[Le Havre]] was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]], whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named \\'\\'Franciscopolis\\'\\' after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\\n\\n====Americas====\\n{{further|France-Americas relations}}\\nIn 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of [[Lyon]] in financing the expedition of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of [[New York City]], naming it [[New Angoulême]], and claimed [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the French crown.

This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts.

He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V.

The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile.

He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]].

The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was [[Françoise de Foix]], Countess of [[Châteaubriant]]. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly [[Mary Boleyn]], mistress of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450</ref>\\n\\n==Francis I in films, stage and literature==\\nThe amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by [[Fanny Kemble]], \\'\\'Francis the First\\'\\', and the 1832 play by [[Victor Hugo]], \\'\\'[[Le Roi s\\'amuse]]\\'\\' (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester [[Triboulet]], the inspiration for the 1851 opera \\'\\'[[Rigoletto (opera)|Rigoletto]]\\'\\' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].\\n\\nFrancis was first played in a [[George Méliès]] movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), [[Aimé Simon-Girard]] (1937), [[Sacha Guitry]] (1937), [[Gérard Oury]] (1953), [[Jean Marais]] (1955), [[Pedro Armendáriz]] (1956), [[Claude Titre]] (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). [[Timothy West]] (1998) and [[Emmanuel Leconte]] (2007– 2010).\\n\\nFrancis was portrayed by [[Peter Gilmore]] in the comedy film \\'\\'[[Carry On Henry]]\\'\\' charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis).\\n\\nFrancis receives a mention in a minor story in [[Laurence Sterne]]\\'s novel \\'\\'[[Tristram Shandy]]\\'\\'. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\\n\\nHe is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel \\'\\'Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé\\'\\', where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\\n\\nHe often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – [[Mary Boleyn]] (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels \\'\\'The Lady in the Tower\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],\\'\\' \\'\\'The Last Boleyn\\'\\', \\'\\'Dear Heart, How Like You This?\\'\\' and \\'\\'Mademoiselle Boleyn\\'\\' feature Francis in their story. He appears in [[Hilary Mantel]]\\'s \\'\\'Wolf Hall\\'\\' about Henry VIII\\'s minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] and is often referred to in its sequel, \\'\\'Bring Up the Bodies\\'\\'.\\n\\nFrancis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel \\'\\'Courtesan\\'\\' about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.\\n\\nFrancis appears as the patron of [[Benvenuto Cellini]] in the 1843 French novel \\'\\'L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio\\'\\' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].\\n\\n[[Samuel Shellabarger]]\\'s novel \\'\\'The King\\'s Cavalier\\'\\' describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.\\n\\nHe was a recurring character in the Showtime series \\'\\'[[The Tudors]]\\'\\', opposite [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte.\\n\\nHe and his court set the scene for [[Friedrich Schiller]]\\'s ballad \\'\\'[[Der Handschuh]]\\'\\' (\\'\\'The Glove\\'\\').\\n\\nFrancis I (played by [[Timothy West]]) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by [[Dougray Scott]]) are central figures in the 1998 movie \\'\\'[[Ever After]]\\'\\', a retelling of the [[Cinderella]] story.

       "     'opening_text': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son.\\n</p><p>A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the <i>Mona Lisa</i> with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.\\n</p><p>For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as <i>le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres</i> (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as <i>François au Grand Nez</i> (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the <i>Grand Colas</i>, and the <i>Roi-Chevalier</i> (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain.\\n</p><p>Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.</p>',\n",

       "     'text': 'The Nika riots (Greek: Στάσις τοῦ Νίκα Stásis toû Níka), Nika revolt or Nika sedition took place against Emperor Justinian I in Constantinople over the course of a week in 532 AD. They were the most violent riots in the city\\'s history, with nearly half of Constantinople being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed. The ancient Roman and Byzantine empires had well-developed associations, known as demes, which supported the different factions (or teams) under which competitors in certain sporting events took part; this was particularly true of chariot racing. There were initially four major factional teams of chariot racing, differentiated by the colour of the uniform in which they competed; the colours were also worn by their supporters. These were the Blues (Veneti), the Greens (Prasini), the Reds (Russati), and the Whites (Albati), although by the Byzantine era the only teams with any influence were the Blues and Greens. Emperor Justinian I was a supporter of the Blues. The team associations had become a focus for various social and political issues for which the general Byzantine population lacked other forms of outlet. They combined aspects of street gangs and political parties, taking positions on current issues, notably theological problems or claimants to the throne. They frequently tried to affect the policy of the emperors by shouting political demands between races. The imperial forces and guards in the city could not keep order without the cooperation of the circus factions which were in turn backed by the aristocratic families of the city; these included some families who believed they had a more rightful claim to the throne than Justinian.[citation needed] In 531 some members of the Blues and Greens had been arrested for murder in connection with deaths that occurred during rioting after a recent chariot race. Relatively limited riots were not unknown at chariot races, similar to the football hooliganism that occasionally erupts after association football matches in modern times. The murderers were to be executed, and most of them were. But on January 10, 532, two of them, a Blue and a Green, escaped and were taking refuge in the sanctuary of a church surrounded by an angry mob. Justinian was nervous: he was in the midst of negotiating with the Persians over peace in the east at the end of the Iberian War and now he faced a potential crisis in his city. Facing this, he declared that a chariot race would be held on January 13 and commuted the sentences to imprisonment. The Blues and the Greens responded by demanding that the two men be pardoned entirely.[citation needed] Justinian and two of his leading officials, John the Cappadocian and Tribonian, were extremely unpopular because of the high taxes they levied, the corruption of the latter two and John\\'s cruelty against debtors. John and Justinian had also reduced spending on the civil service and combated the corruption of the civil service. The many nobles who had lost their power and fortune when removed from the smaller, less corrupt civil service joined the ranks of the Greens. Justinian was also reducing the power of both teams, the Greens seeing this as further imperial oppression akin to the reforms in the civil service, while the Blues felt betrayed. The Roman legal code had a popular image as the biggest distinguishing feature of the civilized Romans as compared to \"barbarians\" (Latin: barbari). The law code was also religiously important as the Romans were believed to be \"chosen by God\", it being a symbol of justice. As such it brought legitimacy with it if an emperor successfully made significant legal reforms but if this process bogged down it showed divine anger. What had taken nine years for the Theodosian code took Justinian just thirteen months. Just before the Nika riots of January 532, however, the pace of reforms had slowed to a crawl. At the same time Justinian was fighting an unsuccessful war against the Persians; while Byzantine victories at Dara (spring of 530) and Satala (summer of 530) had fostered his legitimacy for a short while, the defeat at Calinicum (531) and negative strategic situation damaged the emperor\\'s reputation. On top of that the legal reforms were unpopular with the aristocracy from the start, as they made it impossible to use obscure laws and jurisprudence to avoid unfavorable verdicts, further angering the aristocracy. On top of this both Justinian and his wife Theodora were of low birth - late Roman and Byzantine society was not as class driven as the feudal-dominated society of the west. The Greens were a Monophysite group and represented the interest of the moneyed non-landowners, Justinian being neither of those. When Justinian refused to pardon the two arrested rioters there was already a deep-seated resentment among the general populace as well as among the aristocracy. On January 13, 532, a tense and angry populace arrived at the Hippodrome for the races.[citation needed] The Hippodrome was next to the palace complex, and thus Justinian could watch from the safety of his box in the palace and preside over the races. From the start, the crowd had been hurling insults at Justinian. By the end of the day, at race 22, the partisan chants had changed from \"Blue\" or \"Green\" to a unified Nίκα (\"Nika\", meaning \"Win!\" \"Victory!\" or \"Conquer!\"), and the crowds broke out and began to assault the palace. For the next five days, the palace was under siege.[citation needed] The fires that started during the tumult resulted in the destruction of much of the city, including the city\\'s foremost church, the Hagia Sophia (which Justinian would later rebuild). Some of the senators saw this as an opportunity to overthrow Justinian, as they were opposed to his new taxes and his lack of support for the nobility.[citation needed] The rioters, now armed and probably controlled by their allies in the Senate, also demanded that Justinian dismiss the prefect John the Cappadocian and the quaestor Tribonian. They then declared a new emperor, Hypatius, who was a nephew of former Emperor Anastasius I.[citation needed] Justinian, in despair, considered fleeing, but his wife Theodora is said to have dissuaded him, saying, \"Those who have worn the crown should never survive its loss. Never will I see the day when I am not saluted as empress.\" She is also credited with adding, \"[W]ho is born into the light of day must sooner or later die; and how could an Emperor ever allow himself to be a fugitive.\" Although an escape route across the sea lay open for the emperor, Theodora insisted that she would stay in the city, quoting an ancient saying, \"Royalty is a fine burial shroud,\" or perhaps, \"[the royal color] Purple makes a fine winding sheet.\" As Justinian rallied himself, he created a plan that involved Narses, a popular eunuch, as well as the generals Belisarius and Mundus. Carrying a bag of gold given to him by Justinian, the slightly built eunuch entered the Hippodrome alone and unarmed against a murderous mob that had already killed hundreds. Narses went directly to the Blues\\' section, where he approached the important Blues and reminded them that Emperor Justinian supported them over the Greens. He also reminded them that Hypatius, the man they crowned, was a Green. Then, he distributed the gold. The Blue leaders spoke quietly with each other and then they spoke to their followers. Then, in the middle of Hypatius\\' coronation, the Blues stormed out of the Hippodrome. The Greens sat, stunned. Then, Imperial troops led by Belisarius and Mundus stormed into the Hippodrome, killing any remaining rebels indiscriminately be they Blues or Greens. About thirty thousand rioters were reportedly killed. Justinian also had Hypatius executed and exiled the senators who had supported the riot. He then rebuilt Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia and was free to establish his rule.

       "  'first_paragraphs': 'Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879\\xa0– 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.\\nThe son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.\\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.\\nAlthough initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein\\'s works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.\\nEinstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that \"Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s.\"',\n",

       "  'first_paragraphs': \"Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son.\\nA prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain.\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\",\n",

       "     'text': 'Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de\\' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s\\'amuse (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s Wolf Hall about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel The King\\'s Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis\\'s court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

He was the son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]]. He succeeded his first cousin once removed [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], who died without a son.\\n\\nA prodigious [[patron of the arts]], he promoted the emergent [[French Renaissance]] by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who brought the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of [[humanism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the beginning of French exploration of the [[New World]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first [[French colonial empire]].\\n\\nFor his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \\'\\'le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres\\'\\' (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\').<ref name=\"Knecht\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), 1–2.</ref> He was also known as \\'\\'François au Grand Nez\\'\\' (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the \\'\\'Grand Colas\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Roi-Chevalier\\'\\' (the \\'Knight-King\\')<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival [[Emperor Charles V]], who was also [[King of Spain]].\\n\\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the [[Italian Wars]]. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], meant that France was geographically encircled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]]. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 77–78.</ref> When this was unsuccessful, he formed a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the Muslim sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 224–225, 230.</ref>\\n\\n==Early life and accession==\\n\\'\\'\\'Francis of Orléans\\'\\'\\' was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]],<ref name=\"Knecht\" /> which at that time lay in the province of [[Saintonge]], a part of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].  Today the town lies in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Charente]].\\n\\nFrancis was the only son of [[Charles, Count of Angoulême|Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] and a great-great-grandson of King [[Charles V of France]].<ref>Knecht, Robert. \\'\\'The Valois\\'\\', (Hambledon Continuum, 2004), 112.</ref> His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the [[Louis XII of France|Duke of Orléans]], later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir.<ref name=\"Knecht3\">Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 3.</ref> The [[Salic Law]] prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already [[Count of Angoulême]] after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of [[Duke of Valois]].<ref name=\"Knecht3\" />\\n\\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter [[Claude of France|Claude]] and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 8–9.</ref> Claude was heir presumptive to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] through her mother, [[Anne of Brittany]]. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514.<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 11.</ref> On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the [[Cathedral of Reims]] on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his [[Queen consort of France|queen consort]].<ref>Knecht, R.J. \\'\\'Francis I\\'\\', 16.</ref>\\n\\n==Reign==\\n[[File:François 1515.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Francis I painted in 1515]]\\n[[File:Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, 1494-1547, King of France 1515 (obverse), 1515 or after, NGA 44648.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Maria Pomedelli, François I, (obverse)]]\\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as [[François Desmoulins de Rochefort]] (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named [[Grand Almoner of France|\\'\\'Grand Aumônier de France\\'\\']]) and [[Christophe de Longueil]] (a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by [[humanism]] than any previous French king.\\n\\n===Patron of the arts===\\n[[File:Francois Ier Leonard de Vinci-Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|Francis I receiving the last breath of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1519, by [[Ingres]], painted in 1818]]\\n\\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\\n\\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \\'\\'[[Mona Lisa]]\\'\\' (known in France as \\'\\'La Joconde\\'\\'), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture. Hart & Hicks (ed) Volume 2|date=1996|publisher=Yale|pages=xi}}</ref> Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n\\n===Man of letters===\\nFrancis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Book of the Courtier]]\\'\\', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n\\nIn 1537, Francis signed the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]], which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]], [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Queen of Navarre]], was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \\'\\'[[Heptameron]]\\'\\'.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher [[Claude de Bectoz]], of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Universal Biography: Forming the first volume of series III | authors= Plats, John| year=1826 | publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper | page=301}}</ref>\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in [[Tarascon]].<ref>{{cite book\\n|title=Marguerite de Navarre: mother of the Renaissance\\n|last1=Cholakian\\n|first1=Patricia Francis\\n|last2=Cholakian\\n|first2=Rouben Charles\\n|year=2006\\n|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]\\n|isbn=0231134126\\n|page=49\\n}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Construction===\\n[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Francis\\'s [[Château de Chambord]] displays a distinct [[French Renaissance architecture]].]]\\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the [[Château d\\'Amboise]] and also started renovations on the [[Château de Blois]]. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \\'\\'[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]\\'\\') for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]]. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n\\n===Military action===\\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, \\'\\'Europe in the Middle Ages\\'\\' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years\\' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n\\nMuch of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n\\n[[File:Francis at Marignan.jpg|thumb|Francis I at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\\n\\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with [[Henry VIII of England]] at the famous meeting at the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Field of Cloth of Gold|last=Glenn|first=Richardson|year=2014|isbn=9780300160390|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=32–36|oclc=862814775}}</ref> Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.<ref>Glen Richardson, \"Good friends and brothers?\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (1994) 44#9 pp 20-26.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]] on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the [[Four Years\\' War]]. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after [[Cesare Hercolani]] was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, [[Alonso Pita da Veiga]] and [[Juan de Urbieta]], from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \\'\\'[[Zuppa alla Pavese]]\\'\\' was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.<ref>Andrews, Colman. \\'\\'Country Cooking of Italy\\'\\'.

In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\"<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Francis I. of France | volume=10 |page=935 |first=Jules |last=Isaac |authorlink=Jules Isaac}}</ref> In the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray. \\'\\'Louis XI: The Universal Spider\\'\\' (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1971) p. 314.</ref> during the reign of [[Louis XI, King of France|Louis XI]].  Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" \\'\\'History Today\\'\\' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Detail of a tapestry depicting the [[Battle of Pavia]], woven from a cartoon by [[Bernard van Orley]] (c. 1531)]]\\n\\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.<ref>Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, \\'\\'The Italian Wars: 1494–1559\\'\\', p. 155.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \\'\\'Emperor\\'\\' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\\n\\n===Relations with the New World and Asia===\\n[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]\\n\\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories.

This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n\\n===Religious policies===\\nDivisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. [[Martin Luther]]\\'s preaching and writing sparked the [[Protestant Reformation]], which spread through much of Europe, including France.\\n\\n[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mérindol massacre|Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545]]\\n\\nInitially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister [[Marguerite de Navarre]], who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the [[Place Maubert]].<ref>[[Pierre Goubert]], \\'\\'The Course of French History\\'\\' Psychology Press, 1991, p. 92.</ref>\\n\\nFrancis\\' attitude towards [[Protestantism]] changed for the worse following the \"[[Affair of the Placards]]\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic [[Mass (Catholicism)|mass]]. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.<ref>Goubert, op. cit., p.92</ref> [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.<ref>R. J.

Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the [[Waldensians]], at the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.\\n\\n===Death===\\nFrancis died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday.

He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n==Marriage and issue==\\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]].

      "Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time. Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente. Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father's cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois. In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne's death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort. As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named Grand Aumônier de France) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king. By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun. Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France. Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence[citation needed] that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge. In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the Heptameron. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.[failed verification] Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the Hôtel de Ville) for Paris in order to have control over the building's design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water. Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano. Much of the military activity of Francis's reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis' kingdom. Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow. Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle. Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI. Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529. Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526. After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League. Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\" In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance. The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named Franciscopolis after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns. In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano's letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the Cèllere Codex. In 1531, Bertrand d'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil. In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\" French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French] Lily and the [Ottoman] Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice. In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders. Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539. In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe. Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther's preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France. Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther's theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert. Francis' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice's allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless. Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545. Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor's 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II. Francis' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution. Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image. Francis' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was Nutrisco et extinguo (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname François du Grand Nez (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as le Roi-Chevalier (\"the Knight-King\") or the le Roi-Guerrier (\"the Warrior-King\"). British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success: He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended .... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings. On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children: Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death. Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death. Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless. Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married Catherine de' Medici, had issue. Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue. Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless. Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue. On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry's future wife, Anne Boleyn. The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, Francis the First, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, Le Roi s'amuse (\"The King's Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010). Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film Carry On Henry charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis). Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne's novel Tristram Shandy. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war. He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète's novel Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest. He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels The Lady in the Tower, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Last Boleyn, Dear Heart, How Like You This? and Mademoiselle Boleyn feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall about Henry VIII's minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger's novel Courtesan about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II. Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel L'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio by Alexandre Dumas, père. Samuel Shellabarger's novel The King's Cavalier describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail. He was a recurring character in the Showtime series The Tudors, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte. He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller's ballad Der Handschuh (The Glove). Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis's son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie Ever After, a retelling of the Cinderella story. The plot includes Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey) arriving at Francis's court with the Mona Lisa. He is played by Alfonso Bassave in the TVE series Carlos, rey emperador, opposite Álvaro Cervantes as Charles V.

      "As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the [[Italian Renaissance]] were influential in France.

His academic education had been in [[arithmetic]], geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in [[Hebrew]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, [[real tennis]] and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for [[Italian Renaissance art]], passed this interest on to her son.

      "By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the [[Renaissance]] had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the [[Louvre Palace]], was begun.\n",

While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (known in France as ''La Joconde''), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis' patronage included the goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the painters [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Primaticcio]], all of whom were employed in decorating Francis' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serlio|first1=Sebastiano|title=On Architecture.

      "Francis was also renowned as a [[man of letters]]. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[Book of the Courtier]]'', it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\n",

Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent [[Château de Chambord]], inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the [[Château du Louvre]], transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the ''[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]'') for Paris in order to have control over the building's design. He constructed the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and rebuilt the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The largest of Francis' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|Anne, Duchess of Étampes]].

      "Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the [[King of Naples]].<ref>Hoyt, Robert S. & Stanley Chodorow, ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 619.</ref> Militarily and diplomatically, Francis' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Imperial election of 1519]].  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of [[Milan]]. Later, in November 1521, during the [[Four Years' War]] (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the military activity of Francis's reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis' kingdom.\n",

An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy.<ref name=Mallet>Mallet, Michael and Christine Shaw, ''The Italian Wars: 1494–1559'' (Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited, 2012) p. 153.</ref> Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] on 5 January 1477,<ref>Kendall, Paul Murray.

Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry]], but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under [[duress]]. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.<ref>Glenn Richardson, \"Le roi-chevalier.\" ''History Today'' (May 2015) p. 41.</ref>\n",

      "Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]].

      "After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534.

Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ''Emperor'' (2019) pp 308–312.</ref>\n",

In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.<ref>Richardson, 2015, p. 45.</ref>\n",

      "Francis I (French: François Ier; Middle French: Francoys; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the Mona Lisa with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as François au Grand Nez ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the Grand Colas, and the Roi-Chevalier (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\n"

       "    'extract': '<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Francis I</b> (French: <i lang=\"fr\">François I<sup>er</sup></i>; Middle French: <i lang=\"frm\">Francoys</i>; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Louis XII, who died without a son.\\n</p><p>A prodigious patron of the arts, he promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the <i>Mona Lisa</i> with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis\\' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.\\n</p><p>For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as <i>le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres</i> (the \\'Father and Restorer of Letters\\'). He was also known as <i>François au Grand Nez</i> (\\'Francis of the Large Nose\\'), the <i>Grand Colas</i>, and the <i>Roi-Chevalier</i> (the \\'Knight-King\\') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain.\\n</p><p>Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor, meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2><span id=\"Early_life_and_accession\">Early life and accession</span></h2>\\n<p><b>Francis of Orléans</b> was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine.  Today the town lies in the department of Charente.\\n</p><p>Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father\\'s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne.  Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois.</p><p>In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne\\'s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Reign\">Reign</span></h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as François Desmoulins de Rochefort (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named <i>Grand Aumônier de France</i>) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Patron_of_the_arts\">Patron of the arts</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis\\' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre Palace, was begun.\\n</p><p>Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (known in France as <i>La Joconde</i>), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis\\' patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis\\' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Man_of_letters\">Man of letters</span></h3>\\n<p>Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione\\'s <i>Book of the Courtier</i>, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\\n</p><p>In 1537, Francis signed the Ordonnance de Montpellier, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France.  Francis\\' older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the <i>Heptameron</i>.  Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.\\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Construction\">Construction</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the Château d\\'Amboise and also started renovations on the Château de Blois. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent Château de Chambord, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>) for Paris in order to have control over the building\\'s design. He constructed the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne and rebuilt the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The largest of Francis\\' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the Château de Fontainebleau, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes. Each of Francis\\' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Military_action\">Military action</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies.  Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis\\' death.  Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis\\' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure.  Francis tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519.  However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis\\' First Italian War\" (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Milan. Later, in November 1521, during the Four Years\\' War (1521–1526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\\n</p><p>Much of the military activity of Francis\\'s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis\\' kingdom.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Francis attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII of England at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.</p><p>Francis suffered his most devastating defeat at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years\\' War. Francis was actually captured by the forces of Charles V after Cesare Hercolani was able to injure his horse, leading Francis to be captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". <i>Zuppa alla Pavese</i> was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.</p><p>Francis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" In the Treaty of Madrid, signed on 14 January 1526, Francis was forced to make major concessions to Charles V before he was freed on 17 March 1526. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Among the concessions that Francis I yielded to Charles V were the surrender of any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis I was also forced to recognise the independence of the duchy of Burgundy, which had become part of France since the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy on 5 January 1477, during the reign of Louis XI.  Francis I was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid. A more acceptable agreement, called the Peace of the Ladies, eventually negotiated by Francis’ mother and Charles’ aunt in 1529.</p>\\n\\n<p>Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.</p><p>After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Wurttemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538 after the death of Francesco II Sforza, the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis\\' final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Relations_with_the_New_World_and_Asia\">Relations with the New World and Asia</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull Aeterni regis: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"</p><p>In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\\n</p><p>The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis\\' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named <i>Franciscopolis</i> after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\\n</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Americas\">Americas</span></h4>\\n\\n<p>In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano\\'s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the <i>Cèllere Codex</i>.</p><p>In 1531, Bertrand d\\'Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil.</p><p>In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\"\\n</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Far_East_Asia\">Far East Asia</span></h4>\\n\\n\\n<p>French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the <i>Sacre</i> and the <i>Pensée</i>, reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz.</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Ottoman_Empire\">Ottoman Empire</span></h4>\\n\\n<p>Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\\xa0Lily and the [Ottoman]\\xa0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice.\\n</p><p>In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Bureaucratic_reform_and_language_policy\">Bureaucratic reform and language policy</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or Collège Royal, following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539.</p><p>In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Religious_policies\">Religious policies</span></h3>\\n<p>Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis\\' reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther\\'s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther\\'s theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the Place Maubert.</p><p>Francis\\' attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the \"Affair of the Placards\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice\\'s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Etienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.</p><p>Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Death\">Death</span></h3>\\n<p>Francis died at the Château de Rambouillet on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor\\'s 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II.\\n</p><p>Francis\\' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Image_and_reputation\">Image and reputation</span></h3>\\n\\n<p>Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image.</p><p>Francis\\' personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was <i>Nutrisco et extinguo</i> (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname <i>François du Grand Nez</i> (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as <i>le Roi-Chevalier</i> (\"the Knight-King\") or the <i>le Roi-Guerrier</i> (\"the Warrior-King\").</p><p>British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:\\n</p>\\n<dl><dd>He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended\\xa0.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.</dd></dl><h2><span id=\"Marriage_and_issue\">Marriage and issue</span></h2>\\n<p>On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death.</li>\\n<li>Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death.</li>\\n<li>Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless.</li>\\n<li>Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559).

The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d\\'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry\\'s future wife, Anne Boleyn.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Francis_I_in_films.2C_stage_and_literature\"></span><span id=\"Francis_I_in_films,_stage_and_literature\">Francis I in films, stage and literature</span></h2>\\n<p>The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, <i>Francis the First</i>, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, <i>Le Roi s\\'amuse</i> (\"The King\\'s Amusement\"), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera <i>Rigoletto</i> by Giuseppe Verdi.\\n</p><p>Francis was first played in a George Méliès movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). Timothy West (1998) and Emmanuel Leconte (2007– 2010).\\n</p><p>Francis was portrayed by Peter Gilmore in the comedy film <i>Carry On Henry</i> charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis).\\n</p><p>Francis receives a mention in a minor story in Laurence Sterne\\'s novel <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\\n</p><p>He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète\\'s novel <i>Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé</i>, where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\\n</p><p>He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – Mary Boleyn (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis\\' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels <i>The Lady in the Tower</i>, <i>The Other Boleyn Girl,</i> <i>The Last Boleyn</i>, <i>Dear Heart, How Like You This?</i> and <i>Mademoiselle Boleyn</i> feature Francis in their story. He appears in Hilary Mantel\\'s <i>Wolf Hall</i> about Henry VIII\\'s minister Thomas Cromwell and is often referred to in its sequel, <i>Bring Up the Bodies</i>.\\n</p><p>Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger\\'s novel <i>Courtesan</i> about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.\\n</p><p>Francis appears as the patron of Benvenuto Cellini in the 1843 French novel <i>L\\'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio</i> by Alexandre Dumas, père.\\n</p><p>Samuel Shellabarger\\'s novel <i>The King\\'s Cavalier</i> describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.\\n</p><p>He was a recurring character in the Showtime series <i>The Tudors</i>, opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte.\\n</p><p>He and his court set the scene for Friedrich Schiller\\'s ballad <i>Der Handschuh</i> (<i>The Glove</i>).\\n</p><p>Francis I (played by Timothy West) and Francis\\'s son Henry II (played by Dougray Scott) are central figures in the 1998 movie <i>Ever After</i>, a retelling of the Cinderella story.
