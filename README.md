# TADS_wikipedia_tdih_build_dataset

**Goal:** create a dataset of this-day-in-history events  
  
**Context:** I need a starting dataset of world history events (name, short description, long description, image, and location). I couldn't find public datasets. I'm building one using the wikipedia this day in history data.  
  
**Notes:**  
- the original goal of the project was to build a dataset I can use for various dashboards and for projects like LHOWW (Learn How the World Works), etc. Soon after I started work on the project, I realized it would be nice to grow it, and also build a REST API and a webapp.
- to keep the work better organized, I'm creating three different repositories:
    - TADS_wikipedia_tdih_build_dataset
    - TADS_wikipedia_tdih_api
    - TADS_wikipedia_tdih_webapp
