This repo is part one of a three part project whose end result is a web app where users can view and interact with this_day_in_history events. Users can also CRUD their own events. To make the exploration of events more engaging, events have geolocation data and a public domain image (if possible).

The three parts of the project are:
1. build dataset <small>(this repo)</small>
2. build backend API <small>(with option of making it public API </small>
3. build webapp
